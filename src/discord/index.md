## What is Discord, and why would I want to join?

It's a chat application like Slack &mdash;or if you're old enough to remember it&mdash; IRC. It's a place for listeners of the podcast to congregate and discuss things. There are a variety of topic focused channels, from **cryptocurrency** to **triumphs and fails**. If you're interested in feeling more connected to the community, this is the place to do it.
