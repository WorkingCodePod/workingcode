We all love writing code. Honestly, here on the show, it's hard for us to imagine doing _anything other_ than building beautiful digital products for our beloved customers. But, as a thought experiment - in these post-pandemic times - the crew wanted to share some of the other professions that _could have been_. From ice cream truck driver to organic chef to movie theater entrepreneur, we dive into the untapped world of alternate realities.
