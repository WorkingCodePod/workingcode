If you've listened to the Working Code podcast for any period of time, you've no doubt heard Ben mention the fact that he works on maintaining a **legacy platform** at [InVision][invision]. His role on the legacy team was originally focused on security, stability, and bug-related fixed. However, over the years, he's become increasingly aggressive about adding features and actively improving the legacy experience. This has caused no shortage of controversy both internally to the company, and more broadly within the [Working Code community][working-code-discord]. In this episode, Adam plays Devil's advocate and gets Ben to justify a mode over operation that seems to be - at times - in opposition to his company's larger goals.
