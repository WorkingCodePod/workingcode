This week on the show, the crew talks about side hustles: the very American desire to be making money on the side. While many people in this world _need_ side hustles in order to make ends meet, those in our industry (technology) often incur side hustles as a voluntary affliction. Of course, there's a fixed number of hours in each day; so, you're either earning passive income; or, your taking time away from your other interests (and commitments). This isn't always healthy. Nor should it be seen as a rite of passage - we on the show have a lot of respect for people that are _simply content_ and can live their lives without grinding themselves down to a nub.
