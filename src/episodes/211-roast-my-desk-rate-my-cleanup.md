## [00:00:00] Highlight

[00:00:00] **Adam:** don't listen to Tim. Your heart matters.

[00:00:01] **Tim:** Yeah. Your heart matters, but your cleanup sucks,

## [00:00:24] Intro

[00:00:24] **Adam:** Okay, here we go. It's show number 211. And on today's show we're gonna play a little game of roast my desk. Rate my cleanup. Um,well, I'll, I'll explain what that means a little bit more, in a minute. But first, as usual, let's start with our triumph and fails. It would be Ben's turn to go first.

[00:00:39] **Adam:** He is currently, peeing in Washington DC He's at CF Summit.

[00:00:43] **Tim:** His

[00:00:43] **Adam:** A conference. Yeah.

[00:00:45] **Tim:** people.

[00:00:46] **Adam:** So, he gets an excused absence, which means, Carol, I'm coming to you first.

## [00:00:51] Carol's Triumph/Fail

[00:00:51] **Carol:** All right, so I'm gonna go with it's, it's a twofer. All right. So do you guys know what SBOs are?

[00:00:58] **Tim:** No.

[00:00:59] **Carol:** SBOM? Yeah. It's a software bill of material. So it goes out? Yeah. With each of your packages to like show what packages are referenced, what you're including, like it gives good visibility for security for people using it.

[00:01:14] **Carol:** Like it's something we generate with each one of our releases. Our releases,

[00:01:18] **Adam:** Sounds like a good thing.

[00:01:19] **Carol:** yeah. It's pretty nice. Except I found out today it's not working. So it's not been going out. It hasn't been going out for a couple months. And because so many people are gone, nobody seems to know if we still use it. And then, and then I found out it's being generated another way.

[00:01:37] **Carol:** So the fail is, I found something's not working. The win is, it doesn't matter. 'cause it doesn't need to work here anyways. It's being created somewhere else. So we were just duplicating it.

[00:01:47] **Tim:** See, this is the government offic that he was talking

[00:01:50] **Carol:** I know. We just found one.

[00:01:52] **Tim:** I'm sure that saved trillions of dollars.

[00:01:55] **Carol:** I reached out to security, I reached out to my other developers. Everyone's like, we don't know what this is for, or who actually looks at it. It's just a check box. I'm like, well, someone's been checking it without getting the report from here because it doesn't work. So it just found out it's somewhere else, so I get to take it out.

[00:02:12] **Carol:** So that's a good thing. So it's no longer gonna be part of a GitHub action.

[00:02:16] **Adam:** Yeah. Less code, less, less time

[00:02:18] **Tim:** There we go.

[00:02:18] **Carol:** Yeah, it is. It's a minute and 54 seconds too to run it. So that was with it failing

[00:02:24] **Adam:** Oh, that's the whole process. Not the, not just the S bomb.

[00:02:27] **Carol:** Yeah. So no, no, no. It's a five minute build. It takes a minute, 52, 53 to create the SBO m itself. but then whenever it was uploading, it was getting an XML pars error because of an update to the schema, to the XML schema that now the other tool can't read.

[00:02:45] **Carol:** So turns out we don't need it. That's a good thing. It's gonna go away. Yay.

[00:02:49] **Adam:** Good for you.

[00:02:51] **Carol:** That's me. What about you, Tim?

[00:02:53] **Tim:** I'

## [00:02:53] Tim's Fail

[00:02:53] **Tim:** m, I'm going with a fail. I'm kind of at a weird place today. Just to warn you. So yesterday I have an aunt. So I, growing up I had, my, my Cunningham cousins on my, my dad's side of the family. There's four kids. We're all very close in age. we kind of grew up next door to each other, so they were more like siblings honestly, than.

[00:03:13] **Tim:** Their mom, my aunt, she was working at the garden and then a couple hours later she had a massive stroke

[00:03:18] **Carol:** Oh my gosh.

[00:03:19] **Tim:** and bled out in her brain and they flew her to Atlanta Life, flight her to North Northside Hospital in Atlanta. And then they, they told us today that it's too far gone. She's pretty much brain, brain dead.

[00:03:31] **Tim:** And so they're moving her back down closer to the house to go to hospice so that they can turn her off life support and say goodbye. So yeah, that was quite

[00:03:40] **Carol:** Tim.

[00:03:41] **Adam:** Yeah.

[00:03:41] **Tim:** It's just, you know, it's just surprising 'cause I mean, she was pretty healthy. It's like my mom's a sick one, but she's at home and safe and probably living another 15 years.

[00:03:50] **Tim:** But yeah, she was working in her gardening and then, then a couple hours later was,

[00:03:55] **Adam:** This sneaks up on you.

[00:03:56] **Tim:** yeah. So hold your loved ones close. You never know how long you got.

[00:04:01] **Carol:** Yeah.

[00:04:02] **Tim:** So

[00:04:03] **Carol:** was a stroke, right?

[00:04:04] **Tim:** yeah, it was a stroke. Yeah.

[00:04:06] **Carol:** So scary.

[00:04:08] **Tim:** Mm-hmm. So I just feel bad for my cousins. They're going through it right now, so

[00:04:12] **Carol:** Um, How am I supposed to follow that?

[00:04:14] **Carol:** well, I was just gonna say, like, I find myself as I'm getting older, like when I have a headache, I'm like, is that a headache? Is that a headache? Like, is it just a headache? I'm like, is this, is there something wrong? Should I be worried? Should I be panicking? I used to never do that, but as I'm getting older, I find myself more worried about those unexpected things that just happen.

[00:04:33] **Adam:** Mm-hmm. Got a lot to live for now.

[00:04:36] **Carol:** Yeah, I

[00:04:36] **Tim:** Yeah. So yeah, so sorry to be a bummer, but yeah, that, that, that's me.

## [00:04:41] Adam's Triumph

[00:04:41] **Tim:** Adam, tell me about your fantastic triumph. I'm sure that you have cheer me up, buddy.

[00:04:45] **Adam:** Oh, I'll do my best. you know, honestly, I was trying to come up with a failure earlier and I, I apologize, but everything's coming up Millhouse man, you know, uh,I just don't have, yeah, I just don't have, you know, there are bad things about, days here and there, but I, I feel like I'm just such an optimistic person in general.

[00:05:03] **Adam:** That's kind of my baseline, that it's, it can be kind of hard to focus on the negative sometimes when it's not particularly bad. So. I apologize for having a triumph, I guess. Uh, my triumph is, so we have this, we, so lemme back up a step here. I've talked in the past about, how one of the things my company does is enable our customers to accept online donations, right?

[00:05:24] **Adam:** So our customers are universities and colleges and, they try to, work their contacts or whatever, do play that whole game and basically get rich people to give them money. and so a lot of what we do is facilitating that, right? Make it as easy as possible, as fast as possible, as portable as possible.

[00:05:43] **Adam:** So we have a tool that allows them to just drop like one little JavaScript tag on any page that they have access to edit. and it will embed, an iframe in that spot that is a giving form, right? So they can create whatever beautiful page and whatever CMS they have anywhere across any university property.

[00:06:01] **Adam:** You know, it's like, these are all the reasons you should give money to this whole cause or whatever. And then right there in that page is a form where they can give money so they don't have to leave the page to, to make their donation, which is great. it's a nice little tool. like I said, it's a JavaScript tag and that embeds an iframe that then loads, a giving form from our site.

[00:06:20] **Adam:** And we had some maintenance stuff going on and we just got to the point where like, enough people were using this and it became a little bit of like a, okay, now it's getting used and we need to start thinking about long-term maintenance cleanup and, and deactivation and hiding stuff that's just no longer in use.

[00:06:39] **Adam:** And for a minute there we were like, how the heck do we know which, which of these forms are being used and which aren't? Right? Like it's just a script tag. Like, we don't have much in the way and we're not gonna dig through the engine X logs to, to see, you know, which, which of these giving forms is being loaded.

[00:06:57] **Adam:** How often that would be a massive undertaking.but eventually we figured out that, hey, I mean, they're literally running JavaScript, right? We could just add a little bit of JavaScript that does a check-in that says, Hey, this giving form was loaded and this is the page it got loaded on. So, so now on each of those, like giving page configs where they set up a form that they could embed somewhere, I added a, a list to that settings page that says, here are the URLs that this page has been loaded on, so that they can go back and, and clean it up over time or whatever.

[00:07:28] **Adam:** Clean up their old pages and their CMS and everything too, which is super cool. Super fun. And, and just like a little like, oh yeah, hey, we're running code. We can do whatever we want.

[00:07:37] **Tim:** I mean, yeah, they're downloading your code and including it, so yeah, you can stick something in there.

[00:07:42] **Adam:** Yeah.

[00:07:42] **Tim:** It's interesting. So is an actual, is it a credit card form or is it just a form that's, you know, a call to action kind of button thing?

[00:07:49] **Adam:** No, it's the actual donation form, the choose, you can have it pre-fill, like Okay. If the, the campaign is like everybody should give $20 and 25 cents 'cause it's the year 2025 or whatever, right? Like that's a thing that they do sometimes for the new grads, like the class of 2025, everybody gives $20 and 25 cents.

[00:08:05] **Adam:** and so you can pre-fill an amount or you can have it like, you know, other, and you put in your own amount or you can have like some common, you know, a hundred dollars, $50, $20, whatever, things. And then it's like minimal forms to collect right. The address information. So we know who to credit for the gift.

[00:08:18] **Adam:** And then the credit card form is right there underneath of it. And it depends on which gateway you, a Braintree is more of an embed, and our other option is more of like a, a modal that pops up over top,

[00:08:28] **Tim:** Gotcha.

[00:08:29] **Adam:** it all happens within that iframe.

[00:08:30] **Tim:** How do you, how do you prevent card testing where people from outside just come in and scripting and trying

[00:08:35] **Adam:** Oh, it's, it's a whole thing. We've talked about it on the show in the past. Yeah. Right. Here's how, here's what you would have to defeat in order to, to, yeah, I mean, I won't, I, I'm, I'm getting a little bit, less, or, or I guess I'm getting a little more discerning about what information I'll give away.

[00:08:52] **Adam:** I, I doubt anybody's listening to this and doing anything with that information, but still, you know, I think it pays to be a little secretive. I will say we're using AWS tooling, like a service that they provide that kind of sits in the middle, like not middleware, but, it, you know, it kind of wraps our, our application and helps us avoid bots and, automated users and stuff.

[00:09:15] **Adam:** So,

[00:09:15] **Tim:** So not capture or anything like that. Just

[00:09:17] **Adam:** no, I mean, I think, so this, this, form I do believe does have, like a recapture V two, which can be the invisible one.like that's what we used for a long time and then it just wasn't enough. Right. Somehow people started, I think we talked about that last time, like there's services now where you can pay and, and somebody in a third world country is making Yeah.

[00:09:39] **Adam:** They, they just get a person to do it, and somebody gets paid, you know, 2 cents per cap that they solve or something like that, and they just sit there and solve caps for eight hours, which sounds like a horrible existence, but,

[00:09:50] **Tim:** Huh.

[00:09:51] **Adam:** yeah, I guess that's a service now. so you, you can't just rely on CAPS alone.

[00:09:56] **Adam:** So

[00:09:57] **Tim:** Somewhat of a tangent, did I tell you the job my son Max has now while he is in college?

[00:10:04] **Adam:** I do believe you mentioned something about it. I forget what it

[00:10:07] **Carol:** Tell us again.

[00:10:08] **Adam:** yeah, he's, he's like evaluating AI results or whatever. Yeah.

[00:10:13] **Tim:** So nevermind. Okay. I just wanna make sure I mentioned that Hopefully he'll get paid one day. He

[00:10:19] **Adam:** I was thinking about that. I don't think I said it on that episode, but I was like, you know, that's not too far removed from being like a, not a TaskRabbit, but like a, what is the Amazon, mechanical Turk. Right. You're just signing up to do that, like, oh, yeah. Technically I have a job, dad.

[00:10:32] **Tim:** yeah, yeah. He's like, you know, if, if you go into a place and they don't really know what what it is, and you just say you worked at an AI company, they're gonna, they're gonna overestimate what you actually did.

[00:10:45] **Adam:** Yeah. I was a clock puncher at an AI company. Um, okay,okay,

[00:10:50] **Adam:**

[00:10:50] **Carol:** to your thing, I just posted a link in Discord. it's to the school where my kids go and they have a donate button on the, they have a zoo, like a wildlife center, a little zoo, and then on there they've added a donate button. And once you get into it, you're like, oh, do you wanna give here or somewhere else?

[00:11:09] **Carol:** Like you can select your area to give to. And then it has like a company matching thing. I was like, this is really smart. 'cause when I'm looking at the cute little owls and stuff, I go, I wanna donate money to an owl. Yeah,

[00:11:22] **Adam:** Yeah. Yep. Yeah, it's all about the marketing, right? Like how can we, how can we put the request for money right next to the, the thing that pulls on your heartstrings?

[00:11:31] **Tim:** Yeah.

[00:11:31] **Carol:** And you don't have to make that decision now. You've given that decision to your customer, so I think that's pretty awesome. Yeah.

[00:11:37] **Tim:** Yeah. I don't know who they're using. Give campus.com so it's, they're not as advanced as you. It's, it's basically a link and then they go to an external site that just has Georgia Southern University branding at the top.

[00:11:48] **Carol:** Yep.

[00:11:49] **Adam:** yeah. I mean, gift campus is somebody that we keep our eye on, right? Obviously, you can tell from the name that they are interested in colleges and universities as well, but our, our product is more of like a. It's a platform that has a bunch of tools. It's a whole suite of tools for like that department and related departments at the school.

[00:12:07] **Adam:** So we're trying to kind of take a bigger bite of the pie.

[00:12:10] **Tim:** Gotcha.

[00:12:10] **Adam:** So yeah, they're, they're technically, I guess, sort of in a way, competitors with us,

[00:12:15] **Tim:** Yeah. Good deal.

[00:12:18] **Carol:** nevermind. Don't click that link. It's awful.

## [00:12:20] Roast My Desk

[00:12:20] **Adam:** anyway, I guess that, brings us to our topic for the day. So I mentioned earlier, ro roast, my desk rate, my cleanup. So I, I had this idea while I was watching a recent video on the Syntax YouTube channel. I don't know if this was like officially a podcast episode or if this was just like some, you know, additional content that they put out or whatever.

[00:12:38] **Adam:** They did a thing where they invited listeners to share pictures of their desk just for the purpose of getting roasted, right? Like, share your desk, everybody. It's a, it is a whole thing, right? It's a, it's a trope that developers have totally trash desks with, like food wrappers and, you know, a million.

[00:12:54] **Adam:** Pens and papers and whatever else all over their desk. So, they did a roast my desk thing and they had some fun with it, but I saw that and I was like, you know, was fun. But the, if we were gonna do that on our podcast, it would be different. You know, our whole thing is we're wholesome, we're motivating, we're uplifting.

[00:13:10] **Adam:** How would we do that? And make it a nice thing instead of just making fun of people.

[00:13:15] **Tim:** Oh

[00:13:15] **Adam:** so don't worry, Tim, we'll still make fun of you.

[00:13:18] **Tim:** Okay. All

[00:13:19] **Carol:** I, I was gonna say, you mean to say while also making fun of people.

[00:13:23] **Adam:** You will. That's the thing is we're gonna have some fun. We're gonna, we're it, so I said it's not just rate my cleanup, it's roast my desk and then rate my cleanup. Right? So that's the thing is I asked our listeners and our discord, if they would be interested in. Like ha, using this as motivation to clean their desks up.

[00:13:40] **Adam:** Right? I mean, and I of course needed it myself too, and I was like, this'll be good motivation for me. So basically I said, take a picture of your desk as it is right now. Obviously if you've got like secret, you know, tax papers or whatever on your desk, turn 'em over so we can't see what it is, you know, that sort of thing.

[00:13:56] **Adam:** But

[00:13:57] **Tim:** are the plans to, you know, to bomb the Houthis and Rebels and Yemen?

[00:14:01] **Carol:** That That's in my signal chat.

[00:14:03] **Tim:** Oh, oh, on chat? Yeah. Delete those. Chat.

[00:14:06] **Carol:** Yeah. Yeah.

[00:14:06] **Adam:** and, you know, and then clean your desk and take an after photo and share that with me as well. And then we would look at 'em here on the show. Now obviously this is an audio format show. We're not gonna do a video just for this one episode, so we're gonna do our best to describe what we see.

[00:14:19] **Adam:** We're also going to share the images, in our discord. So that's one place that you can go to look at them. You can look at them on our Instagram. Carol's gonna post 'em there, and I'm also going to post them on our blue sky, so I'll make sure that the links for those are all in the show notes of this episode.

[00:14:34] **Adam:** If you're interested in seeing these photos, they're probably already there waiting for you.

## [00:14:37] Tim's Desk

[00:14:37] **Adam:** So, I guess without further ado, let's look at Tim's, Tim's desk.

[00:14:42] **Tim:** Oh yeah,

[00:14:43] **Adam:** and that opened to the other screen here. Yeah, there we go. So, Tim,

[00:14:48] **Tim:** Mm-hmm.

[00:14:49] **Adam:** this is a nice desk to get here. So, I see, so you got a chair with, like a sweater hanging over the back here?

[00:14:55] **Adam:** Some sort of, uh. needs a sweater.

[00:14:58] **Adam:** It doesn't look like a super comfy chair, but you got like an orthopedic,

[00:15:01] **Tim:** Yeah, got gotta go with those little purple. That was an anniversary gift for my son. Since I sit on my butt. He gave me a nice gel purple mat. Think's expensive, but it's

[00:15:10] **Adam:** I, I tried their purple pillow for a while and it, it wasn't exactly what I was looking for, so it didn't, it didn't last for me, but it was, I could see how that would be super comfortable to sit on.

[00:15:20] **Tim:** great for sitting.

[00:15:21] **Carol:** That's what I got too. Let's talk about that ergonomic like mouse pad you got there.

[00:15:26] **Adam:** Okay.

[00:15:26] **Tim:** Oh yeah.

[00:15:27] **Carol:** limiting your ability to move your mouse, aren't ya? You move

[00:15:31] **Tim:** Limiting what

[00:15:32] **Adam:** got the,

[00:15:32] **Carol:** Yeah. Tiny inch. You can move an inch left or an inch, right?

[00:15:36] **Tim:** you

[00:15:36] **Adam:** that mouse acceleration all the way up.

[00:15:39] **Tim:** yeah, yeah. You'd be amazed, you know, inch to what you can do,

[00:15:44] **Adam:** Well, so this, it looks like it says. I, it almost looks like I was gonna say, it looks like it says Belkin, so it's, it's, it's got the, the built-in gel wrist

[00:15:52] **Tim:** Oh yeah. It's

[00:15:53] **Tim:** and then, and then it's just like, yeah, Carol was right. It's like four or five inches wide and like eight inches long. That's it. Yeah,

[00:16:00] **Carol:** mouse is easily two inches wide, so

[00:16:02] **Tim:** yeah, yeah. But I mean, yes, if you get the full two monitor action there, you can,

[00:16:08] **Adam:** we got a nice mechanical keyboard here.

[00:16:10] **Tim:** yeah. Yeah. Close red.

[00:16:12] **Carol:** And what's up with the, the monitor to the right? Is it just not working or is that how you leave it? All the

[00:16:18] **Tim:** Whenever I watch tv, I move it to the side. So I, I had, was watching something on tv because it is a huge TV behind

[00:16:25] **Adam:** Okay. So, so you do like, set it up as an external monitor and you just have it like side by side with your laptop when you're using it. Okay.

[00:16:32] **Tim:** But this is in, this is after work mode, right. So I lower, lower the lid, shove the, the second monitor to the Oh, to the right. And then, yeah. Oh, you see my little d and d character,

[00:16:42] **Adam:** Who is this guy?

[00:16:43] **Tim:** so that, that is Nick's world shot. He is my. Goblin gunslinger that, in our latest campaign that we're doing, so I three DI designed it, actually, I didn't design it.

[00:16:53] **Tim:** Our d our, our, dungeon master designed it in a 3D program and I 3D printed it and then painted it. So yeah,

[00:17:00] **Adam:** Oh, cool.

[00:17:01] **Tim:** he's a cool little dude. Little

[00:17:02] **Carol:** gun.

[00:17:03] **Tim:** he does, yeah. Yeah. Big old. It's a, it's a blunder bus,

[00:17:07] **Adam:** And then there are th i, I count three stacks of paper. So you got one down here next to the keyboard with your glasses on it.

[00:17:13] **Tim:** yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:17:14] **Adam:** one, it looks like the basket is sitting on something.

[00:17:18] **Tim:** basket is, see, there's like a external like, port kind of thing where you, it's the, the, what they call the laptop dock, the dock for the laptop. So I can like bunch of USB connections and HDMI connections.

[00:17:31] **Adam:** Gotcha.

[00:17:32] **Tim:** That box behind there. I have no idea. What's I, I, I probably look at that maybe every two years.

[00:17:38] **Tim:** That was in my, that was in my office at work. When they told us to pack up for Covid, I grabbed that box, didn't know what was in it. And still don't know what in it

[00:17:46] **Adam:** This looks important.

[00:17:47] **Tim:** Yeah. It's a nice leather, it's a nice leather box. I just put it there.

[00:17:50] **Adam:** And then, you got, so your nice headphones here, and is that a coffee mug warmer behind it?

[00:17:54] **Tim:** No, so the ear, the little, the ear cup that goes, so Right. If you look right now on our

[00:18:00] **Adam:** yeah.

[00:18:01] **Tim:** an ear cup on

[00:18:02] **Adam:** Oh, no,

[00:18:02] **Tim:** the left side, so I've ordered a new one, so I couldn't get it back on. I, I can't figure out how to get it, so Yeah, I just ordered a new one.

[00:18:09] **Carol:** broken headphones.

[00:18:11] **Tim:** broken headphones.

[00:18:11] **Carol:** Okay.

[00:18:12] **Adam:** that looks comfortable.

[00:18:14] **Tim:** yeah. It's not comfortable.

[00:18:15] **Tim:** Right. Yeah. My left, my left ear is killing me right now.

[00:18:17] **Adam:** That sucks

[00:18:18] **Tim:** But yeah, I got a, I got a nice $165 Kawasaki studio quality headset coming tomorrow. So I actually, next time we record I'm gonna try to see if I can use that. 'cause supposedly the microphone is like,recording level, so we'll see.

[00:18:35] **Adam:** Cool. Well, uh,yeah, yeah, yeah. So, okay, so we roasted your desk. Now let's rate your, your desk cleanup and, this after photo. Uh, uh,we, this was actually, I'm not even joking. This was the after photo that I had opened. No, he sent the same photo twice.

[00:18:52] **Tim:** I'm not cleaning my desk for this.

[00:18:53] **Carol:** Oh,

[00:18:54] **Tim:** I I'm not doing it.

[00:18:56] **Adam:** hang on. Is that, is that

[00:18:57] **Carol:** a forest

[00:18:57] **Adam:** on the floor? There's, there's another, there's paper on the floor

[00:19:01] **Tim:** still there. Let me see it. It is a $5 off ACE Hardware. Coupon.

[00:19:07] **Carol:** Oh, there you go. It is

[00:19:09] **Adam:** expired four years

[00:19:10] **Tim:** it expired December 31st, so yeah, I guess I'll, it a clean up by getting rid of that. There you go.

[00:19:16] **Carol:** you've done one thing.

[00:19:17] **Tim:** I've done one thing. That's right.

[00:19:19] **Carol:** We're proud of you.

[00:19:20] **Tim:** Thanks. Thanks. So how do you, how do you rate it? A one out of what we, what's the, what's the score

[00:19:25] **Adam:** get, let, let's go five stars.

[00:19:27] **Tim:** Five stars. Okay,

[00:19:28] **Adam:** and so I think, one of the things we have to consider is potential, right? So, you know, it's like a difficulty level on ice skating, right? You, you get a maximum level of points, right? so I don't know. I think, I'm gonna give you, you know, a good zero stars on your cleanup there,

[00:19:45] **Tim:** Thanks. Appreciate it. Hey, uh,

[00:19:46] **Adam:** know, you get a half star for your, for picking up one thing off the floor,

[00:19:49] **Tim:** a half star. Okay, thanks. That's generous. What do you think, Carol?

[00:19:52] **Carol:** I am, I mean, I was gonna double Adam's, you know, score there, you know, with a

[00:19:57] **Adam:** of, of the zero.

[00:19:58] **Tim:** you're double zero.

[00:19:59] **Carol:** doubling your zero there, man.

[00:20:01] **Tim:** squared.

[00:20:02] **Carol:** Yeah,

[00:20:04] **Adam:** you can't trust the, the Georgian judge.

[00:20:07] **Tim:** Yep.

[00:20:07] **Adam:** She, she's, biased. Alright.

[00:20:10] **Carol:** just, I'm just glad that there's no sand everywhere. Like, when I get back, I will like do this test thing for you guys.

[00:20:16] **Adam:** Yeah.

[00:20:17] **Tim:** Okay.

## [00:20:18] Adam's Desk

[00:20:18] **Adam:** so now we're looking at my desk. so I'll, I'll let you guys describe it and I'll zoom in on whatever you

[00:20:22] **Carol:** Oh man. can we just say, do you have two trash cans under your

[00:20:26] **Tim:** yeah. What's, what's the deal with that?

[00:20:27] **Carol:** kitchen trash

[00:20:29] **Adam:** Yeah. There, there are kitchen size trash cans. One of them is for

[00:20:31] **Tim:** five gallon

[00:20:33] **Adam:** so you can see one of 'em has like a bag in it.

[00:20:35] **Tim:** Uhhuh

[00:20:35] **Adam:** Uh,I think they're more than five gallon. Lemme see what it says here.

[00:20:37] **Carol:** 7.5 liters. I don't know.

[00:20:40] **Adam:** I dunno. It doesn't say anywhere obvious on it, but I'm gonna, I'm gonna go with at least 10, probably 15 gallon.

[00:20:47] **Adam:** now they're probably about 10 gallon anyway. There's two of them. The one with the bag, you can see the, like, the liner

[00:20:51] **Carol:** Yeah. Yeah.

[00:20:52] **Adam:** trash. The other one is recycle. Back from, and so it's a remnant of when I used to like go through Mountain Dew, like my body weight in Mountain Dew every day.

[00:21:00] **Tim:** Right.

[00:21:01] **Adam:** it was, it was, too much of a pain in the butt to have to carry my cans down, all the time. So I just got a recycle bin here so that I could just fill 'em up there and then take it out to our house, recycle bin, like when it got full. So that's why there's two.

[00:21:15] **Tim:** gotcha. Okay.

[00:21:17] **Carol:** What about like all these boxes on the left corner?

[00:21:21] **Adam:** Yeah. So that is, that's,

[00:21:24] **Carol:** Holy

[00:21:25] **Adam:** pile. That is a pile that got moved to my office very recently, like within the last week because they had been on the kitchen counter, like out of the way on the kitchen counter, like in the, in that corner where you put the stuff that you're avoiding. Over by the toaster oven and it's stuff that has been there for me to deal with that I hadn't been dealing with.

[00:21:43] **Adam:** And the wife was finally like, you're gonna do something with this stuff one day. Right? And that day, that day it moved from the kitchen counter to my office as, as to like, okay, it's in my sight line, now I have to do something with it. Right? So there, there are two things in there. the smaller box is the, the box that our doggie doorbell, came in, right?

[00:22:02] **Adam:** I told you guys, I think about the, the doorbell that I bought, wireless thing. and it's like the extra bell part, which I haven't put up yet because I'm not sure if we're gonna use it. 'cause we kind of switched to the, because, which call it baby monitor. And then the other slightly bigger box is, it's an Apple watch that I bought for my son for Christmas and it ended up not being compatible with his phone.

[00:22:23] **Adam:** His iPhone is a little bit too old. and he kind of waited for a while and, and just recently told me he'd rather just like we resell the watch and give them the money. So. It's there as, as a reminder for me to sell it so that I can give them money.

[00:22:37] **Carol:** You gotta take action on those things. Do you also have a broken headphone there

[00:22:42] **Adam:** no, you're talking about this right here.

[00:22:44] **Carol:** the left. It looks like Tim's broken headphone.

[00:22:46] **Adam:** This right here.

[00:22:47] **Carol:** Yeah.

[00:22:48] **Tim:** one of those coffee warmers?

[00:22:49] **Adam:** That, that is, it's not a coffee warmer. That is, I, I used to be a candle boy. right. I, I, I like my office to smell nice. It just, it's nice to walk into the room. It's like, Hmm. Peppermint Right. Smells good. Uh,and I, well, in my office it's usually a mix of peppermint and dog farts.

[00:23:04] **Adam:** 'cause the dogs like to hang out with, you know, I'm the only one home all day. Right.

[00:23:08] **Tim:** and you don't fart, obviously. Never.

[00:23:10] **Adam:** never. And, the, that I never fart. That's not okay. I, but anyway, the dogs come in to hang out with me 'cause they wanna be near the people in the house. And I'm the only person at home all day. So they'll come sleep in here and stink up the joint, which is a big part of the reason why it was a candle portion.

[00:23:24] **Adam:** but I recently learned about slash decided to get into like wax melts, which is all the pros of candles without any of the cons, right? You don't have any fire that like a cat can knock over and start your house on fire. no soot in the air, no smoke from having to blow out the candle. and I can tell you if you get to become a candle person, you have like those like really big candles that have multiple wicks.

[00:23:46] **Adam:** they, there's like, you have, there are rules for these candles. You have to burn 'em for a minimum of a certain amount of time, a maximum, a certain amount of time and, and other things as well. So the wax thing has been fantastic. That's just, it's a little wax melt warmer thingy and basically it's wax with, oils in it, like, essential oils or, or whatever, super fragrant oils.

[00:24:06] **Adam:** And it makes everything smell nice. And then I just hit a switch and it turns off. And, you can see kind of in the background to the left of that. There's a cap that I made so that I can cover it up and the cats, if they happen to walk across my desk, won't step in hot wax and, and, track it all over the house.

[00:24:21] **Tim:** They gotta pay extra for that. So

[00:24:25] **Carol:** a cluttered mess.

[00:24:26] **Tim:** Yeah,

[00:24:26] **Adam:** It is,

[00:24:27] **Tim:** is very

[00:24:27] **Adam:** it is.

[00:24:27] **Tim:** It's tons of stuff. Got a Kleenex box there. What's the, your phone is there? What's going on with your phone?

[00:24:34] **Adam:** Where do you see my phone?

[00:24:35] **Tim:** Like you see some sort

[00:24:36] **Carol:** You

[00:24:36] **Tim:** underneath the ma middle monitor.

[00:24:38] **Adam:** Oh, this. Yeah. So that's, that's the baby monitor.

[00:24:41] **Tim:** Oh,

[00:24:41] **Adam:** that's, that's my back door. Yeah. So, and then, so right next to that is the, the microphone that I use for the podcast. I'll just go through the, the stuff on the desk here. So there's a, there's a, one of those like gorilla pod things with like armature wire arms that, it's a, it's got a phone mount, but it's like a little mini tripod.

[00:25:01] **Carol:** It's like a foot tall. It's got a phone mount on it, and then the legs are armature wire so you can like, hook, bend it around and hook it on stuff. not being used, you guys. It's just

[00:25:08] **Adam:** No. Yeah, it's, it, it's there because it doesn't have a home, right? Like, it doesn't have an official place that it belongs. So it's just like, it kind of floats around.

[00:25:15] **Tim:** I, I do like how all your three monitors are like off and leaving your lap laptop. They're off the, tabletop, you know,

[00:25:22] **Adam:** That way I can, I have more room to put random crap on my

[00:25:25] **Tim:** there you go. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I see

[00:25:28] **Adam:** yeah, so there's that, there's the, the, the white, thing, the, I don't what you call it, AirPods case. Yeah, that's, that's my old AirPods case. 'cause the microphone started to go bad on 'em, so I had to replace 'em and I,

[00:25:38] **Carol:** there's two now.

[00:25:40] **Adam:** yeah. The, the new one is over by, it's on my little keyboard mat.

[00:25:43] **Adam:** Yeah. so yeah, there's that. I have a tape measure on here. This like cardboard tube. This is a poster that I bought for myself, or it might've been a Christmas gift, but like from a year ago. and, it's on my desk specifically to, to motivate me slash remind me that it's theirs to make a frame for it.

[00:26:00] **Adam:** Right.it's the,

[00:26:02] **Tim:** to be working.

[00:26:03] **Carol:** Yep.

[00:26:04] **Adam:** it's doing a great job. It's the, the patent drawing of the, of early parachutes, which is pretty cool. I got a, a stack of papers, the little white box underneath my laptop. That's, a, that's my, my wax melts that are unmelted so far. That's like the ones that I bought or whatever. So they needed a

[00:26:20] **Carol:** a good place to store them. Yep.

[00:26:23] **Adam:** Yeah. I mean, it's, they're close by where they would be used. It's just clutter though. pile of papers and like u not currently in use cables, right? Like iPhone charger and USBC cables on top of the papers'. My other pair of headphones, um,

[00:26:37] **Carol:** Another mouse pad that you're not using?

[00:26:39] **Adam:** it is, so it's, it's a mouse pad. That was a Christmas gift from one of my kids.

[00:26:44] **Adam:** It's a photo of me doing a skydive out of a hot air balloon. So I can't, I

[00:26:49] **Carol:** you all that clutter for your desk.

[00:26:51] **Adam:** I. He got it for me when I didn't have a, a better mouse pad. Like I didn't, I didn't have the like desk mat thing that's under my keyboard in the photo. Yeah. and so it was actually being used as a mousepad for a very long time.

[00:27:04] **Adam:** but when I got the desk mat, I decided, you know, I'm gonna keep it over here. It's a useful place to like set my phone or my headphones, keys, that sort of thing.

[00:27:11] **Tim:** You know, I, I should have got, I, I got the working code pod desk mat. I, I

[00:27:18] **Adam:** You

[00:27:18] **Tim:** it

[00:27:18] **Carol:** you using it?

[00:27:19] **Tim:** I, I don't know why I'm not using it. I should, should, should have had it out. Yeah.

[00:27:23] **Adam:** wow, man.

[00:27:23] **Tim:** little brand representation.

[00:27:25] **Adam:** Nice. Yeah, so, moving across the desk here. So yeah, I do have, two external monitors up on monitor arms and I have my laptop on a monitor arm, like laptop holder thingy as well. So they're all elevated off the desk. It's nice. Yeah.

[00:27:39] **Tim:** visual studio run in there.

[00:27:40] **Carol:** Yep.

[00:27:41] **Adam:** Visual Studio code and, and Yep. And our Discord, the working Code Discord on one screen there.

[00:27:47] **Tim:** Yep.

[00:27:48] **Adam:** I got a stack, so you can't really see it all that well. But like this, the red thing kind of in the middle of the desk, that's our 3D printed grid finity bin. If you, if you know, you know, and it's surrounded by a bunch of other 3D printed grid finity bins. It's just like a organizational system. and then there's another paper and, and under, yeah, underneath that paper is a stack of the, like, bases for grid finity.

[00:28:11] **Adam:** again, you know, if you know, you know, and then these green and black boxes. So a little bit to the right of the speaker. They're 3D printed grid finity bin. So like I, I, you know, I printed a bunch of this stuff and I just haven't put it into use yet. So that's, I have moved it to where it will be used, but I still haven't,

[00:28:25] **Tim:** I do, I do like that. Did you turn that bowl behind it or do you,

[00:28:28] **Adam:** I did, yeah, so there's,

[00:28:29] **Carol:** a cool bowl.

[00:28:30] **Adam:** there's actually three bowls there.

[00:28:32] **Adam:** You can't see the, you can't see one of 'em because it was like in the inside the, there, it was a small one inside the, the tall

[00:28:39] **Tim:** dulling it.

[00:28:39] **Adam:** Yeah. But, so yeah, these are bowls that I turned and I do, you know, they're, they're nice looking, so I just, it's nice to have one on my desks. I keep one there, but I did move the other, well, I have moved the other two since.

[00:28:51] **Adam:** Right when we get to the, the after, you'll see. but I'm trying to work my way across here. So, in front of the, the large grid finity bins, there's a box of glasses wipes to like clean your glasses, get the smudge and grease off. There's a half of an Amazon bubble mailer. 'cause I, so when I sell the stuff that I 3D print, I like to, I keep my bubble mailers from all the crap that I order off Amazon.

[00:29:12] **Adam:** And then I just cut 'em to the size that I need and I turn 'em inside out so it's not Amazon logos. And then I tape 'em shut and tape on a am on my shipping label. So that's how I mail my stuff.

[00:29:22] **Tim:** Greta Thornberg will be very proud.

[00:29:24] **Adam:** Thanks. and then I've got my circle mug, and which I, I do use every day. that follows me around the house.

[00:29:30] **Tim:** And then behind that is a Contigo. Coffee mug that, has been there for, had been there for weeks and probably months, under my desk. Yeah. So, is this a standing desk kind of thing? It

[00:29:42] **Adam:** it's a sit stand, conversion desk. Yeah. Yeah. So, I'm sitting in a chair right now, and for the picture, I just pushed it back behind me.

[00:29:49] **Tim:** but I see you got that little monopod

[00:29:51] **Carol:** Mm-hmm.

[00:29:52] **Adam:** yep. I have a, I have a stool, and the stool is like a, you're right, it's a monopod and it's got like a rounded bottom so you can kind of like lean it around.

[00:29:59] **Adam:** Um,and I have a, a, what you call it, a balance board. Yeah. And then back there in the corner, that's like some accessories for my chairs specifically, there's like a tray that can attach to it. And I think I took the headrest off my chair, which is detachable, and I put it back in the corner. I was like, that's not a better place for that stuff.

[00:30:18] **Adam:** Right. and then the, that little black box on the bottom right. That's my, that's the box that my keyboard came in. It has not been there since I got the keyboard. I only recently took it out when I was having some issues with a one particular key and I needed to like, get the key cap pull, but it's been there since then for like a month.

[00:30:36] **Adam:** alright. So,I think that's,

[00:30:38] **Tim:** Yeah, it's a, yeah, it's, it's a mess. Yeah.

[00:30:41] **Adam:** So let's look at the after.

[00:30:42] **Tim:** I feel better now.

[00:30:43] **Carol:** Uhhuh.

[00:30:46] **Tim:** Oh, okay. Here's your

[00:30:48] **Carol:** Okay. Okay. Okay.

[00:30:49] **Tim:** oh, I could see your, the, the desk is actually brown. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. That's

[00:30:54] **Adam:** I'm, did I, I didn't mention, I made the desktop like the, it's, it's a sit stand desk. It's electric. I bought it, it's from autonomous.ai. I'm not sponsored. but then I bought the, I bought the no surface desk surface option. I just made my own. It's, it's made outta walnut, which is nice.

[00:31:09] **Tim:** nice

[00:31:10] **Adam:** so yeah, so I cleaned it up.

[00:31:11] **Adam:** Basically the stuff that's still on there. My circle mug. One of the bowls. Go ahead Tim. You sound

[00:31:16] **Tim:** Kleenex. Yeah. Your, yeah, your, your wax. Your wax lid. Your keyboard's there.

[00:31:21] **Carol:** Mm-hmm. Headphones.

[00:31:23] **Adam:** some, there's some pain samples here behind the keyboard. those are there specifically. 'cause I'm, I, listen, I do a lot of DIY stuff. my one rule is I don't paint, I don't paint in the house. I don't paint projects, I don't paint, period. and, but, so my wife volunteered at one point not that long ago, to paint my office.

[00:31:43] **Adam:** She's just like, you gotta tell me what colors you want. So I went and I got some paint samples to, to try stuff out,

[00:31:49] **Carol:** You got decision to make.

[00:31:50] **Adam:** Yep. And that was only like two weeks ago, so I'm, I'm perfectly on schedule there.

[00:31:55] **Carol:** So, since I can't ask this to everyone else who submitted pictures, I'm gonna ask this to you. Did you just take a laundry basket and throw everything in it and put it behind your desk and then take the picture? Because that's what I would've

[00:32:07] **Adam:** not everything. There's a couple of things. Let's see, what did it, what just got moved? So the calipers just got moved across the room. That's like, what, what was sitting on top of the bubble mailer on the back corner? 'cause those need to go down to my shop. the, the bowls are just sitting across the room.

[00:32:21] **Adam:** 'cause I need to find a better home for them. Now. It's like, yes. I, some of it just did get like pushed out of frame basically. but it's, it's this. Okay, so this is how my A DHD manifests is doom piles, right? I call 'em doom piles didn't organize, only moved, right? So I moved the problem somewhere else. so now the bowls are sitting on a dresser that I had keep in my office for like craft supplies for, it's like storage for my wife's craft Supplies are, wrapping paper and stuff.

[00:32:48] **Adam:** But, on top of that dresser, there's like six jars from MD candles that have been used. And the bowls, and some of the grid finity stuff. a lot of what was on my desk did have a home, did get moved to its home.

[00:33:03] **Carol:** Good job. Good

[00:33:04] **Adam:** but yes, there are a handful of things that just got pushed outta the way.

[00:33:08] **Carol:** job. Well, I think you did good. Overall, it

[00:33:10] **Tim:** Yeah, I, I'll give you a, I'll give you a four out of five on the, on the cleanup. Yes.

[00:33:14] **Adam:** Thanks. Yeah. So the, honestly, the thing that amazed me the most was like, after I got all the clutter off the desk, I was like, oh my God, my desk is so dusty, just like so much little dirt and dust. It's like, ew. And it gave me a good opportunity to like see it so I could clean it up. So that was nice. Shall we move on?

[00:33:31] **Tim:** Let's move on.

[00:33:32] **Carol:** you, do you wanna score.

[00:33:33] **Tim:** I gave

[00:33:34] **Adam:** Oh yeah, sure. Yeah.

[00:33:35] **Carol:** Yeah, I give, I'll give you a four outta five.

[00:33:37] **Tim:** Okay.

[00:33:37] **Adam:** Alright, cool.

## [00:33:38] Brian's Desk

[00:33:38] **Adam:** So this is a submission from our, friend of the show Patron, Brian, uh, spiffy Tech in our discord.

[00:33:45] **Tim:** yeah.

[00:33:46] **Adam:** he even went to the trouble of labeling his before photos, so he is got a bunch of like, arrows and stuff. So, it'll be easier. I'm gonna start left to right, but I'm gonna point out something here.

[00:33:55] **Adam:** On the right side of the, of the photo, there's a giant speaker. it's, so he said, I think it's like three and a half foot tall

[00:34:01] **Tim:** Whoa.

[00:34:02] **Adam:** on either side. And then, so starting in this upper left corner, he says more items atop speakers that are just, you can't see 'em in the photos,

[00:34:11] **Carol:** He lives at his desk. He must live

[00:34:13] **Adam:** he must.

[00:34:14] **Tim:** Yeah. This is like a homeless person's car. This is.

[00:34:18] **Adam:** So, oh, you know what? I think he has the same keyboard. It's a very similar keyboard as me. He's got like a slightly more compact version of the key, key Kron K one Pro, which is what I have. His is very similar. He is just, his arrow keys are more like smooshed in where I have space around my arrow keys.

[00:34:33] **Carol:** But other than that, I think we're the same keyboard.You said, this is Brian.

[00:34:37] **Adam:** Brian? Yeah, spiffy

[00:36:44] **Adam:** right, let's go over to the left side of the desk here. So he is got a coffee mug. he's got what looks like a earphone case. It says belongs on the q charging pad behind a laptop.

[00:36:55] **Tim:** is that? Is that like a coffee pods? What's that? What's the putting off ordering refills? 'cause they're dollar side. What

[00:37:01] **Adam:** 'cause they're

[00:37:07] **Carol:** Mm-hmm.

[00:37:07] **Adam:** I am not sure.

[00:37:08] **Tim:** A little tip for you if, I don't know if you have like a home goods store in your town. We get, like, anytime we go to Home Goods, they have a section with co with the Nespresso pods and they're usually for like, you know, normally like seven, $8 for like a dollar or $2.

[00:37:22] **Tim:** We, we buy all of them. We'll spend like a hundred dollars, a hundred dollars and buy the entire store out of those pods.

[00:37:27] **Adam:** So, yeah. Okay. So most of the left side of the desk here just says Christmas, right? So there's like,

[00:37:32] **Tim:** What was that book? ColdFusion? What is what it he always learned ColdFusion. Look at the, no. Oh no. Okay.

[00:37:42] **Tim:** yeah. Which is, which is funny. I did the, interviews, I interviewed him and I always asked interviewees like their favorite, the most impactful book they read about software.

[00:37:51] **Tim:** And he mentioned that one. So

[00:37:53] **Carol:** Oh,

[00:37:54] **Tim:** I think he, I think he put there that there on purpose for me.

[00:37:58] **Carol:** see if

[00:37:58] **Adam:** oh, down here on the left it says cubby of inappropriate starches. I'm guessing that's like snack food

[00:38:04] **Tim:** Yeah. Looks like Ferrero Cher. What else he's got? La Lance, uh, peanut butter crackers. Yeah.

[00:38:12] **Adam:** That's funny.

[00:38:13] **Tim:** Yeah. And so he is got a big roll of, instead of wimpy little Kleenexes for his gold bond, he's got a big giant paper towel roll.

[00:38:20] **Carol:** towel. Roll

[00:38:21] **Tim:** Yep.

[00:38:23] **Adam:** This, I don't know what this is. This looks like another maybe set of, headphones or something, but it just says eBay. Like, I don't know if that means he is supposed to sell him on eBay or whatever. Yeah.

[00:38:31] **Tim:** Boy, he's got lots of meds.

[00:38:33] **Adam:** Oh, cracker Box keeps LEDs from illuminating bedroom.

[00:38:46] **Carol:** Yeah.

[00:38:47] **Tim:** That's a lot of pills.

[00:38:48] **Adam:** that would be cutting. If I put my bedroom, my office in my bedroom, that would cut my commute like in maybe a third or half. Like,

[00:38:56] **Tim:** Yep.

[00:38:57] **Adam:** and then I had to ask him about, so he sent me these photos. I was like, wow, whatever this thing is. It looks super cool. He, it's a, it's a, hang on, I wanna read it to you. It's basically, it's for the speakers. It's a, a preamp or an amp or something.

[00:39:08] **Carol:** Oh,

[00:39:09] **Tim:** It looks like homemade.

[00:39:10] **Carol:** Mm-hmm.

[00:39:11] **Adam:** yeah, it, it's like, it's open,

[00:39:12] **Tim:** Mm-hmm. Isn't

[00:39:13] **Adam:** open air. it's got a clear top and bottom.

[00:39:16] **Adam:** I gotta pull up my DM with him so I can.

[00:39:18] **Carol:** It almost looked like a lock pick thing on the left side.

[00:39:22] **Adam:** On the, like to the left of the, of the amp or

[00:39:26] **Carol:** that little clear box that has like

[00:39:28] **Adam:** Oh yeah.

[00:39:29] **Carol:** on it. The left looks like some type of like,nope.

[00:39:33] **Adam:** Oh, in the, in the coffee cup

[00:39:35] **Carol:** Nope.

[00:39:36] **Adam:** in the, to the right.

[00:39:37] **Carol:** the thing you're looking at Adam.

[00:39:40] **Adam:** The thing I'm looking at. Oh, this guy

[00:39:42] **Carol:** that, that thing, yeah. On the left, that little rollie thing looks like a lock pick

[00:39:45] **Tim:** It kind of does, doesn't

[00:39:46] **Carol:** like a

[00:39:47] **Adam:** the knob. Yeah. It's probably the volume adjust knob, but

[00:39:49] **Carol:** That makes more sense now.

[00:39:52] **Adam:** Yeah. so he said it is a stereo amp to drive the three foot, six inch speakers on either side of his desk.

[00:39:58] **Carol:** Neat.

[00:39:59] **Adam:** and then yeah, he is got his phone, phone holder wires everywhere.

[00:40:03] **Tim:** I'm just surprised he doesn't, I mean, he doesn't really have a multi-monitor set up. He has one monitor and a huge, giant, giant like TV screen monitor, but they're cloning each other.

[00:40:13] **Adam:** Yeah, it's massive.

[00:40:15] **Tim:** That's massive. So, yeah. Okay.

[00:40:17] **Adam:** Alright, well let's see.

## [00:40:18] Brian's After

[00:40:18] **Adam:** The after,

[00:40:19] **Tim:** Oh yeah. Hopefully he cleaned it up. Oh, that's, that's, oh, that's nice.

[00:40:23] **Adam:** looks like he dusted too. You can see there, like especially over here,

[00:40:26] **Tim:** but he kept the gold bond of the paper towels, so you know.

[00:40:29] **Carol:** I don't think he just tested it. It looks like he used pledge. It's all very

[00:40:33] **Tim:** Oh, it's very

[00:40:34] **Adam:** Yeah,

[00:40:35] **Tim:** I can see my reflection,

[00:40:36] **Carol:** Mm-hmm.

[00:40:37] **Tim:** even though it's a photograph, which is crazy. I.

[00:40:39] **Adam:** yeah. That's how shiny it's,

[00:40:40] **Carol:** Mm-hmm.

[00:40:41] **Adam:** yeah. I mean, so the, the box of shameful starches or whatever it was called is still there.

[00:40:45] **Tim:** Uh huh.

[00:40:46] **Carol:** Oh wait, no, sorry. I was, think I was looking at the Christmas area. Sorry.

[00:40:50] **Adam:** That's Oh, the Christmas area. Yeah. The where the book and the papers and all this stuff is. Yeah.

[00:40:55] **Tim:** So what's his white coffee mug? What's, what's I always find

[00:40:58] **Adam:** It looks like a, it's a radio station. WCOM 1 0 3 0.5 FM car, somewhere North Carolina. That looks like

[00:41:07] **Tim:** North Carolina. Okay.

[00:41:10] **Carol:** Cool.

[00:41:11] **Tim:** His pills are still there. What's that white bottle next to his pill? It's to the left

[00:41:15] **Adam:** I'm guessing some sort of a supplement or something like that. Like, so I, I happen to know he's a, he also works out, he's a power powerlifter, so I'm guessing this is

[00:41:24] **Tim:** Oh, so those aren't pills, that's enhancement

[00:41:26] **Adam:** Yeah, it could be creatine.

[00:41:28] **Carol:** Yeah.

[00:41:28] **Adam:** Could be creatine. He is a big di big dude. yeah, it could be anything, but

[00:41:33] **Tim:** We need, we need to get him in Benelli or like a wrestling match.

[00:41:37] **Carol:** Arm wrestling go.

[00:41:38] **Tim:** you go.

[00:41:38] **Carol:** Yeah,

[00:41:39] **Adam:** I honestly, this is a,

[00:41:40] **Carol:** is so

[00:41:41] **Adam:** massive improvement.

[00:41:42] **Tim:** Oh, it is? Yeah. I mean the, the wood on his, the desk is beautiful.

[00:41:46] **Carol:** Yeah, it's really pretty

[00:41:47] **Tim:** Looks like a, what do you, what kind of wood do you think that is? Wood bastar.

[00:41:52] **Adam:** honestly, I'm gonna go with like a, it looks like naughty pine, that's been stained to me,

[00:41:57] **Carol:** nice.

[00:41:58] **Tim:** Oh, you naughty pine.

[00:42:00] **Carol:** fine.

[00:42:00] **Tim:** He's so naughty.

[00:42:02] **Adam:** but yeah, you can see like the, the desk now, you can actually see the desk is almost as wide as the monitor

[00:42:07] **Tim:** Yeah, yeah. Yeah,

[00:42:09] **Adam:** you guys, so you

[00:42:11] **Tim:** off. I, I, I can't get him a five out of five. This cleanup. This is, I can. Good job. Good job. Good. Yeah.

[00:42:17] **Adam:** yeah, and, and this is just a, a comment for me, like I'm a, I'm a big desk kind of guy. You, Tim, you and and Brian both have these, I would say narrow desks, just not very

[00:42:26] **Tim:** small. Mine's.

[00:42:28] **Carol:** I have an L-shaped desk. That's mine's very big.

[00:42:31] **Adam:** I got, I got important business to do on my desk. I need a lot of desks so I can do a lot of business. Right.

[00:42:37] **Tim:** Mm-hmm. why they call it business desk.

[00:42:40] **Adam:** That's right. Alright, let's go next one.

## [00:42:43] Sean's Desk

[00:42:43] **Carol:** another listener and, and, patron of the show. Sean Callahan. have

[00:42:47] **Tim:** already, it's already, it's already clean.

[00:42:49] **Adam:** yeah, so he, he's, he's, his note for this one was he works in an office and he just, you know, you can only get away with so much in an office.

[00:42:57] **Adam:** guys, man, jeez.

[00:43:01] **Adam:** yeah, so let's see what we can describe here. So it, it does look like a, like fairly narrow workspace. Almost like a cubicle, but it's not cubicle walls.

[00:43:09] **Tim:** No, it looked like sheet rock.

[00:43:10] **Carol:** It looks like a cute rock. Yeah.

[00:43:12] **Adam:** it's nice colors and bright.

[00:43:13] **Carol:** pad,

[00:43:15] **Adam:** Yeah. That looks a lot like your mouse pad, Tim.

[00:43:17] **Tim:** he's got the Booby B. Yeah. Exact same one. Yeah. It's the exact same one. Oh, that's a Belkin.

[00:43:23] **Adam:** I can't see the Belkin logo, but I'll take your word for it.

[00:43:25] **Tim:** It's hidden by the anchor mouse.

[00:43:27] **Adam:** Yep. He's got a photo here of, I'm guessing that's him and his wife. I mean, I've seen him. I know that that's what he looks like, but that looks like Disney World.

[00:43:35] **Carol:** If not, he's got some answering to do.

[00:43:37] **Tim:** Right.

[00:43:38] **Adam:** so he also has two, monitors up on monitor arms. Looks nice.

[00:43:43] **Tim:** are the little what? All the little hearts. These, what's

[00:43:45] **Adam:** what?

[00:43:46] **Adam:** Hearts. Oh, uh, they're like sticky notes, but heart, heart shaped sticky notes. Let's see, let's see if we can zoom in on his password.

[00:43:54] **Carol:** we didn't get that. They're probably love notes. Let's be real guys.

[00:43:57] **Tim:** yeah, yeah,

[00:43:58] **Adam:** he is got a, a, a very typical office desk phone. The, the phone you get assigned when you're in a, when you're in a corporate, IT office,

[00:44:07] **Tim:** You pray, never rings.

[00:44:09] **Carol:** I see a hanger on the right hand side that I would use for my purse because he's using it for a mask.

[00:44:15] **Adam:** Oh yeah, yeah,

[00:44:16] **Carol:** have to wear a mask or if that's from months ago.

[00:44:19] **Adam:** you would hang your purse on that. That's interesting. I would hang my headphones on that.

[00:44:23] **Carol:** Yeah, I would. I would stick my purse on that.

[00:44:25] **Adam:** Okay.

[00:44:25] **Tim:** hopes and dreams on that.

[00:44:27] **Carol:** Oh, just like that

[00:44:28] **Adam:** So, alright. Behind the mask we see he's got like a balance board. 'cause he told me this is also a sit stand desk. So it's adjustable. You can see the buttons there. He is got his balance board.

[00:44:37] **Tim:** electric. Sitan, yeah.

[00:44:38] **Adam:** Yep. And then, uh, flip

[00:44:41] **Carol:** of flipflops must

[00:44:42] **Adam:** I dunno. Maybe he,

[00:44:43] **Tim:** They're

[00:44:43] **Adam:** yeah, I was gonna say maybe he showers at work or something.he also has the circle mug because Sean and I, yeah, Sean and I actually talk about circle stuff pretty frequently. Um,it, so I, I don't know what this is. It almost looks like the computer itself, that's black box on the left side of his desk.

[00:45:00] **Adam:** That's kind of old school looking. Um,it's got

[00:45:03] **Tim:** spinner on top.

[00:45:04] **Adam:** fidget spinner. I can't tell what that is. Like behind those

[00:45:07] **Tim:** Fractal. Fractal. The brand is fractal. C-P-C-P-U.

[00:45:13] **Carol:** oh, it could just be power. Yeah.

[00:45:15] **Adam:** who knows? little, USB hub back here.

[00:45:18] **Carol:** Yeah. Yeah.

[00:45:19] **Adam:** Kleenex. So over here on the, in the corner, he's got like a, a filing cabinet looking thing. again, picture of him and his wife

[00:45:25] **Carol:** Or we think

[00:45:27] **Adam:** or mistress, you know, no, no judgment.

[00:45:29] **Adam:** nice. A CDC looking pin glass like it, and a, a gift bag of some sort. So this is a Yeah, yeah. All in all,

[00:45:38] **Carol:** notebook,

[00:45:39] **Adam:** yeah, all in all slightly cluttered. I'd say, you know, if, if five is,

[00:45:44] **Carol:** slightly cluttered.

[00:45:45] **Adam:** if five is, is super clean, and, and zero is trashed, then I'd say your, your baseline level here, Sean, is like a three and a half or a four, right?

[00:45:55] **Adam:** This is, it could be tidier, but this is a, you know, you're living a clean life,

[00:45:59] **Tim:** Yeah. This is very corporate,

[00:46:04] **Adam:** So let's look at Sean's after. So

[00:46:07] **Tim:** same.

[00:46:08] **Adam:** it's not exactly the same. So look over here. I, I had the first, the same thought. The first one. I opened it. I was like, did he pull a tip on me and send me the same stuff? Right. So the, the gift bag is gone. The notebook is put away. The photo over here is the only thing on that.

[00:46:20] **Adam:** I don't look

[00:46:20] **Tim:** he, he pulled up the working code pa, code pod

[00:46:23] **Carol:** Hey, that's us.

[00:46:25] **Tim:** That's us. Yeah. That's our, that's our

[00:46:26] **Adam:** about coding, but not code. That's us. Yep. but yeah, I mean, like, I honestly think that these wires on his desk from the keyboard and the watch charger and stuff, like, I don't even think that those moved.

[00:46:36] **Tim:** No, he, he, he picked up his dirty flip flops and put 'em on top of the balance board.

[00:46:41] **Adam:** Yep. And then the, the, the desk calendar got stood up. It was just laying flat on the desk.

[00:46:46] **Tim:** Yeah.

[00:46:47] **Carol:** So I will say I think he did what I, I kind of accused you of Adam. I see the key in his filing cabinet now, so I'm pretty sure everything went into the

[00:46:56] **Adam:** But let,

[00:46:57] **Tim:** Exactly. Yeah. Can we open, can we open the filing? He, he just

[00:47:01] **Carol:** threw it away. Just, just chunk it. Yeah.

[00:47:04] **Adam:** Hang on right here. Bring this window over. Look at that.

[00:47:09] **Tim:** no, he sent a photo of,

[00:47:11] **Adam:** the notebook is put in there.

[00:47:12] **Tim:** he just shoved everything

[00:47:13] **Adam:** can I, I don't know if I can rotate, this photo, but, yeah. So, the, the, there's like a index card right here.it's, it's upside down, but it says, Sean, thanks for being a friend and for supporting the pod.

[00:47:26] **Adam:** I put in extra stickers for you and it's signed by Adam.

[00:47:33] **Tim:** He is got some little Easter eggs

[00:47:34] **Carol:** love our friends of the show,

[00:47:36] **Adam:** Yep. it's got a, a unicorn, a rainbow themed affirma affirm.

[00:47:41] **Tim:** Affirmations

[00:47:42] **Adam:** Oh, but it looks like it says a affirms or a affirm.

[00:47:45] **Tim:** Oh, we, yeah, we gotta, we gotta find out about that from him. What's that about,

[00:47:49] **Adam:** Yeah. Then what was there?

[00:47:51] **Tim:** Sean? You're good enough. You're smart enough and doggone it, people like

[00:47:55] **Carol:** They're with the cup. Yep.

[00:47:57] **Adam:** then there's the, there's the, so he is got the contigo, the, the former water bottle preci down in the, in the blower drawer here.

[00:48:04] **Tim:** I, I love how PE offices will give you a filing cabinet and like no one has any files to put in,

[00:48:10] **Carol:** Yeah.

[00:48:11] **Tim:** maybe the accountant, but everybody else, they're like, what is this thing?

[00:48:16] **Carol:** Don't give me paper.

[00:48:16] **Adam:** Yep. Accurate. All right. So let's, let's read Sean's cleanup here. He went, I think he went from like a four to a four and a half, honestly.

[00:48:24] **Carol:** Yeah.

[00:48:25] **Tim:** I, yeah, I mean, I, as far as, see, I'm gonna go opposite here. He had nothing to clean up and he just shoved it in a desk. So I'm, I'm giving it a one. It was

[00:48:33] **Adam:** Okay. Yeah, like it's a, it's a one, it's a one for low effort. Like the, the, the maximum attainable score was like a, a, a, a one star and he

[00:48:42] **Tim:** I mean, he stuck the landing, but honestly it was like he just a somersault.

[00:48:46] **Adam:** Right. Yeah. Yeah.

[00:48:47] **Tim:** wasn't a a, a double twist with, you know, a gainer and whatever.

[00:48:51] **Adam:** X.

[00:48:52] **Tim:** Triple axle

[00:48:53] **Carol:** Sean, you did great. You did great, man. Don't listen to

[00:48:56] **Tim:** I mean, yeah. I mean, you're

[00:48:58] **Adam:** don't listen to, don't listen to Tim. Your heart matters.

[00:49:00] **Tim:** Yeah. Your heart matters, but your cleanup sucks,

[00:49:04] **Carol:** Oh.

[00:49:05] **Adam:** Alright. Oh,

[00:49:06] **Tim:** schedule rocks. You, you keep things maintained. I

[00:49:10] **Adam:** That's right.

## [00:49:11] Adrian's Desk Setup

[00:49:11] **Adam:** All right, so this is, from another listener, Adrian. Adrian Moreno.

[00:49:16] **Tim:** now. So Adrian is like a desk dude. He's always posting images of his setups and he's, I think he's moved into a new house, so he's like very mu top of mind about getting stuff organized.

[00:49:28] **Adam:** I remember he sent me a note with this. So he says, this is an early, early iteration of my current desk, and over the weekend after a good cleaning, so this is before,

[00:49:36] **Carol:** All right. So I will say, you really don't need two mouse and keyboards. Why you got that? I got two. Mouse and keyboards because I'm not allowed to plug things in and I have to be careful.

[00:49:45] **Adam:** well, it could be. It could be like a work computer, home computer situation.

[00:49:51] **Tim:** Gaming computer

[00:49:52] **Carol:** yeah.

[00:49:53] **Adam:** Yeah.but yeah, there's a lot of wires here. There's a clock sitting in the

[00:49:56] **Tim:** I mean, if you notice, so the main, the middle keyboard and mouse is right-handed. The other one is left-handed. Maybe he like pair programs with his wife. I dunno, maybe that's like they're tagged secret coding tag team and

[00:50:09] **Adam:** It is on the left of the keyboard. I don't know. Does that technically qualify as a left-handed

[00:50:13] **Carol:** well, the ball

[00:50:14] **Adam:** track ball mouse.

[00:50:15] **Tim:** the ball's in a different spot. Yeah.

[00:50:17] **Carol:** I don't know.

[00:50:17] **Adam:** but you still, you would hold it with your right hand.

[00:50:19] **Carol:** though. Yeah, you still

[00:50:20] **Adam:** Yeah. There's just, it's just a different oriented mouse. Right. So

[00:50:24] **Carol:** use your fingers or you use your thumb.

[00:50:26] **Adam:** Yeah. So on, on the white mouse toward more towards the center.

[00:50:29] **Adam:** It's got a red ball and you, it looks like you move the ball with your fingers or it looks like the ball kind of sticks through and it's a little bit on the, on a thumb side as well, but the buttons are like above, up and down on, on the thumb. And the, the black mouse, it's like thumb is the track wheel.

[00:50:45] **Adam:** Then there's like a traditional mouse on the side.

[00:50:47] **Tim:** Okay. Yeah, we're all, I'm, I'm sitting here making like fingering

[00:50:51] **Adam:** Yep. We're all,

[00:50:52] **Carol:** are.

[00:50:53] **Tim:** We're all, we're all, we're all trying to touch the, the, the mouse.

[00:50:57] **Carol:** Cute bracelet that

[00:50:59] **Adam:** think that's a fidget toy. That's a fidget toy that my kids have. Yeah,

[00:51:02] **Tim:** looks 3D printed.

[00:51:03] **Carol:** Looks

[00:51:03] **Adam:** it does kind of, but it's not, it. They're, I've had like the exact same thing in slightly different colors. It, so it like,

[00:51:10] **Carol:** of, the snakes you had when I was a kid.

[00:51:13] **Adam:** Yeah, you can, so you can click, bend it, and click it, like clicks into detent, in, in like 90 degree increments.

[00:51:19] **Adam:** And, and some of them bend one way and some of them in the, the other way. So you can kind of make funky shapes out of it. It, they're fun. Good way for kids to pass the time.

[00:51:28] **Tim:** it's a lot, lot of cable management in the back

[00:51:30] **Adam:** Yeah. What do you, what do you suppose this is? What?

[00:51:32] **Carol:** That looks like an audio converter thing. The thing that you plug your headphones into you. Yeah.

[00:51:38] **Tim:** Could be a soldering iron.

[00:51:40] **Adam:** no.

[00:51:41] **Tim:** I think you, I think you're right. Audio

[00:51:43] **Carol:** Yeah.

[00:51:43] **Adam:** a little lamp underneath the

[00:51:45] **Tim:** He's got a, he is got a clock. I mean, why do you need a digital clock behind the monitors? Don't, doesn't the computer have like a clock in the bottom tray?

[00:51:53] **Carol:** Maybe it's in a bedroom.

[00:51:54] **Adam:** Who knows?

[00:51:55] **Tim:** Who knows? I do like the monitors. So the nice identical three monitor setup. That's really nice.

[00:52:01] **Carol:** And I like that they're higher. 'cause then you know your neck feels better. But those is cables. You gotta do something about the cables. I hope he did something about the cables.

[00:52:09] **Adam:** Well, let's find out.

[00:52:10] **Tim:** And it, wait, so that looks like that gold wire there, it looks like speaker wire,

[00:52:15] **Adam:** Oh yeah, that,

[00:52:16] **Tim:** that looks like Yeah. Speaker wire. Is that going into that black box?

[00:52:20] **Carol:** It looks like on the two left side that, that there are

[00:52:24] **Adam:** some over here as well. Yeah. That, I think that's a good item. I think that those are speakers like mounted behind the monitors, which is interesting.

[00:52:32] **Tim:** It is. That is interesting.

[00:52:34] **Adam:** Wonder if that

[00:52:34] **Tim:** got a left channel right channel. 'cause there's another one on the right. Okay. Very interesting.

[00:52:39] **Carol:** Alright, let's see.

[00:52:41] **Adam:** Let's see the after. So I think having the screens on with the, the wallpaper is a little bit of a cheat. We gotta

[00:52:45] **Tim:** Yeah. Yeah.

[00:52:47] **Adam:** that outta the equation here.

[00:52:48] **Carol:** the PC's moved too. The PC is up on the desk. It's moved down. The cable management has been kind of taken care of, so now he is moved his

[00:52:55] **Tim:** secondary keyboard has been moved.

[00:52:57] **Carol:** Yeah. Everything's way more organized.

[00:53:00] **Adam:** Definitely is a different clock even.

[00:53:03] **Tim:** yeah. Is it a

[00:53:04] **Carol:** different fidget toys. Yeah. It's a,

[00:53:07] **Adam:** Oh yeah, you got it. Is got a little pop it over here.

[00:53:09] **Carol:** Mm-hmm.

[00:53:10] **Tim:** Pop it.

[00:53:12] **Adam:** You, you haven't heard that?

[00:53:13] **Tim:** Yeah, no, I

[00:53:14] **Carol:** They're cool.

[00:53:15] **Tim:** And his, his, that little black box is either behind the laptop and we just can't see it. Or he's moved it,

[00:53:21] **Carol:** yeah,

[00:53:22] **Tim:** but the speakers are still, where's the cable management on the, on the

[00:53:26] **Carol:** They're on the monitor arms. If you

[00:53:27] **Tim:** Oh, nice. So, yeah. So yeah, he wrapped it up. He wrapped it

[00:53:30] **Carol:** you go. You made it up already. You did

[00:53:32] **Adam:** I'm not.

[00:53:33] **Tim:** gotta give you points for that.

[00:53:34] **Adam:** I'm not sure the speakers are still behind the monitors.

[00:53:36] **Carol:** I looks like they're gone.

[00:53:38] **Tim:** Yeah. What's the, what's the deal?

[00:53:40] **Adam:** Hard to say.

[00:53:41] **Tim:** Adrian? Are you cheating? Are you cheating? What's going on, Adrian?

[00:53:44] **Carol:** Is it different arms?

[00:53:46] **Adam:** I don't think so.

[00:53:47] **Carol:** Oh,

[00:53:48] **Tim:** I mean, the monitors look exactly. Positioned the same.

[00:53:52] **Adam:** Yeah. Let me pull 'em up side by side

[00:53:54] **Carol:** I saw like little pins. Oh yeah. They just changed a little. Yeah, they still have the pins in the bottom.

[00:54:00] **Tim:** But whatever that thing is underneath the monitors on the old picture is gone. So I don't know if he, where the speakers have gone to, if those Indeed was what, what they were.

[00:54:10] **Carol:** What they were, oh no. It looks good.

[00:54:13] **Tim:** I mean, regardless it looks good.

[00:54:14] **Carol:** Mm-hmm.

[00:54:15] **Adam:** Yeah. This is definitely a, a, a workspace you can take home to mom.

[00:54:18] **Carol:** Yeah.

[00:54:19] **Tim:** exactly. Cable management, I think is the hardest part of

[00:54:21] **Carol:** So

[00:54:22] **Adam:** for sure.

[00:54:23] **Carol:** real.

[00:54:24] **Adam:** Yeah. I have like three cable trays on the bottom of my desk because I keep so much crap on my desk. I have a, a lamp that I no longer use and it just like so many cables.

[00:54:34] **Tim:** There's cables, you're like, you don't know what they do and you're afraid to take everything out. 'cause you pro you think you'll never get it back together. And there's cables that haven't been used for two years and you're like, I don't know, I just, I don't touch it. It'll all, it'll all fall apart.

[00:54:46] **Tim:** It's a, in a quantum state, and if you look at it, it'll all destroy itself.

[00:54:50] **Tim:** Alright, so how about a rating here? five. Adrian, just for the cable

[00:54:55] **Carol:** I agree.

[00:54:56] **Tim:** advantagement. Five out of

[00:54:56] **Adam:** Yeah. Yeah. You know, and, and honestly the, he is got the, the second keyboard is better stored off to the side over here. I like that a lot.

[00:55:04] **Carol:** And the mouse pad. Look at this cool mouse pad he added, or

[00:55:07] **Adam:** Like the desk mat looking thing. Yeah.

[00:55:09] **Tim:** What is the, can you go look, is that like a, A chart of like constellations

[00:55:14] **Adam:** So that looks like, that looks like Australia.

[00:55:17] **Tim:** Okay. It's a map. Yep.

[00:55:19] **Adam:** So it is a globe map. Yeah.

[00:55:21] **Tim:** Well done.

[00:55:22] **Carol:** Well done.

[00:55:23] **Adam:** And and it only took him two hours and 38 minutes.

[00:55:26] **Tim:** There you go. Yeah. On short, on short notice, you kind of popped this on I

[00:55:30] **Adam:** No, no, no. I'm just, it was a joke about the clocks. So one says seven 10, the other says 9 48.

[00:55:35] **Tim:** gotcha.

[00:55:36] **Adam:** Bad joke, MWO.

[00:55:38] **Carol:** You tried?

[00:55:40] **Adam:** Alright, so, I don't know, what'd you guys think of that? Do you enjoy that? Should we do that again?

[00:55:44] **Carol:** Yeah.

[00:55:44] **Tim:** I don't know. Let our listeners decide. I don't know. I mean, we can see the pictures, so

[00:55:48] **Adam:** Yeah, well again, you know, go to our Discord Instagram or blue sky. The photos will be on all those places.

[00:55:54] **Carol:** be. You can follow along.

[00:55:57] **Adam:** I think we are gonna have to make sure we do double, like, have Tim's before and after photos separate, we should label them.

[00:56:04] **Tim:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. I need to label.

[00:56:07] **Adam:** And I'll Photoshop out that piece of paper you picked up during the show.

[00:56:12] **Carol:** This was removed.

[00:56:13] **Tim:** Yep.

[00:56:14] **Adam:** Alright. well then I.

## [00:56:17] Developer Experience and Desk Space

[00:56:17] **Tim:** So before we go, so one of the things I'm gonna be focusing on in the next few months is trying to improve the developer experience

[00:56:27] **Carol:** Ooh,

[00:56:29] **Tim:** for. Anyway, I'll, I'll, I'll talk about my, my, my new role next week. But anyway, yeah, so I have a, I have a new role and I'll, I'll, I'll talk about that next week if you guys wanna hear what I'm going to be doing, actually, in addition to what I'm already doing,

[00:56:41] **Adam:** your second job.

[00:56:42] **Tim:** my second job, yeah, trying to figure out how to improve developer experience for people.

[00:56:47] **Tim:** And so how much does your desk space play into developer experience? I'd like to hear from, I'd like to hear from the listeners if they have any thoughts on that. How important is that and whose responsibility is to make sure that it's done?

[00:56:59] **Carol:** we have feelings on that one. Yeah.

[00:57:03] **Adam:** You know, I, I, I am the type of person, if it's not obvious from this episode, I. Look at a minimalist desk, and I just find it so appealing. And then I sit down and try to work at my desk and it's like, but I need this and I need this and I need this and I need this. And it just doesn't work out that way.

[00:57:20] **Adam:** And then, you know, a week later, there's so much crap on my desk. So that, honestly, that was the whole motivation here is like, I, I can't be alone in that.

[00:57:29] **Carol:** Needing to clean your desk.

[00:57:31] **Adam:** yeah. And, and this was a, a good motivator for me. And I'm hoping it provides that same motivation, for other people as well. At least it did For a couple here.

[00:57:39] **Adam:** And hopefully a, if you wanna, if you wanna play along, you know, send us your before and after photos, we'll save a few up and we'll do this again sometime.

[00:57:46] **Tim:** and I'll say, I'll, I'll tell you why I did not clean my desk. I sa I save, I save that for a day where there is this particularly bad task that I have to do, like maybe letting someone go or like ending a relationship with a customer or, you know, something that I'm really just dreading and the only thing I can do before, like say the call is at 11 and I'm up at nine or whatever, and I'm working, I'm like.

[00:58:11] **Tim:** I actually can't physically mentally work, so I will save those days. So I didn't have that today. So it's like I had some personal stuff going on, but it's like, as far as like other stuff, it's like, you know, I will, I will save cleaning the desk for the day. What I just need to clear out

[00:58:28] **Tim:** gets in so I can do the thing I don't want to do.

[00:58:32] **Carol:** Yep.

[00:58:32] **Tim:** So maybe next time
