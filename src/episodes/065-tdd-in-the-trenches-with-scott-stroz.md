Testing code is like taking out insurance: until you _need_ it, it can be hard to understand why it's so important; it can be hard to understand what everyone is _raving_ about. And so, you continue writing your code without tests. And, everything is fine, until one day it isn't. And in that moment, you _finally_ see for yourself what value automated testing could have brought to the table.

On today's show, the crew talks to [Scott Stroz][scott-stroz] about his experience with Test Driven Development (TDD); and, about how he has come to understand that testing makes possible what would have otherwise been impossible. With solid testing practices in place, Scott was able to refactor an _exceedingly convoluted_ intake form that rendered 25 buttons, 6 unique workflows, and took the user through up to 28 steps. Crunch those numbers and try telling me that the chance of making a mistake isn't absolute. And yet, thanks to a rigorous test-first coding methodology, Scott was able to completely refactor this workflow - _from the ground-up_ - and delivery it on-time and without error!
