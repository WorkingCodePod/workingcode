On today's show, the crew discusses a variety of topics. By which, I mean, Ben waxes philosophical on the subjective nature of _everything_; and, how he wants to live in a world where those who choose to indent code with 2-spaces may peacefully coexist alongside those who choose to indent code with tabs. Also, Adam body-slams his younger brother into a concrete floor. And then, gets in trouble because he let blood get on the carpet. Be sure to listen for Adam's pro-tips for removing blood stains.
