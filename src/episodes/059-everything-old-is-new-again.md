It's easy to be flippant about how often our industry seemingly "discovers" the programming practices and paradigms that experienced engineers have been talking about for _decades_. But, the truth is more complicated and nuanced. The landscape of the web is evolving at a breakneck speed; processing power and storage capacity are going up while costs are coming down; and, the needs of different applications are beginning to diverge massively.

As an industry, we're not _"rediscovering"_, we're [_"Yes, and'ing"_][yes-and]. We're constantly learning up on timeless techniques and then trying to apply them to the new constraints and pressures of the modern web. Some of these experiments are going to seem familiar; but, each step in this journey is an attempt to answer a new question or speak to a new problem. Everything old is new again because the context is _always changing_ and is in need of new consideration.
