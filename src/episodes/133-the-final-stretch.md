Starting a new project is always exciting: there's so much potential, so many visions of grandeur. _Completing a project_, on the other hand, is always a challenge. In the engineering world, we often joke that the _last 90%_ of a project takes just as much time as the _first 90%_ of a project. Inspired by the [GitHub Guide: Finish Your Projects][github-guide], we wanted to talk about why finishing a project is always such a slog; and, how we can keep the momentum moving forward in order to get our projects over the finish-line.
