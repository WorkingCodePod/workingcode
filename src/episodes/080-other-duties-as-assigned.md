In each role, there are the responsibilities that get listed on the job board; and then, there's all the random stuff that they ask you do to once you show up. On today's show, the crew discusses the latter: those strange and wondrous "extras" that sometimes get rolled-up into an honest day's work. Topics include: buying nipple cream, picking up cigarette butts, cleaning bathrooms, taking out trash, driving to remote server locations, restocking photocopiers, and - perhaps worst of all - getting pushed into Sales.
