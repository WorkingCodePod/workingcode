A year ago, on Episode 36, we talked about [blogs and digital gardens][working-code-36]. Today, Adam and Ben, our resident authors, dive deeper into how they got started writing, what keeps them writing today, and how the act of - and the _engagement with_ - writing has changed over the years. The advent of Social Media, along with the doubling of new programmers every 5-years, has certainly created a contentious relationship with long-form content. And, is at times, antithetical to our hope of bringing readers along for the journey.
