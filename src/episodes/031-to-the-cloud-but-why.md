There is no _one thing_ that is "The Cloud". Instead, there are a set of _general characteristics_ that underscore cloud technologies: we can provision, deprovision, and scale resources at will; we don't need to manage those resources; and, we only pay for the resources that we use. But, even within this definition, there is a broad spectrum of technologies that more-or-less fit the bill. From Geocities, to managed hosting, to elastic clouds, to distributed edge-computing, lots of things _kind of look like "The Cloud"_, depending on how hard you squint.

This week, the crew talks about what The Cloud is and why people are so keen to adopt it. And, of course, since nothing is _truly free_, we'll also take a look at the drawbacks of cloud-based architectures.
