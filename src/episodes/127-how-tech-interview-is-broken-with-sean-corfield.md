On today's show, we talk to [Sean Corfield][sean-corfield] about his take on the "Tech Interview" process. With over 40 years of experience at companies like Macromedia, Adobe, and World Singles, Sean has been on both sides of the interview table; and, has been personally responsible for hiring countless engineers. His perspective that most tech interviews are "broken" might be taken with some apprehension if it weren't for the fact that, in 30-years of hiring, Sean has _never once_ had to fire an engineer for lack of ability. So, he's clearly figured out how to hire the _right people_ using a _proven and repeatable process_.
