On today's episode, we get to pull up the floor boards and once again peer into the dark recesses of Ben's brain: all the random and, frankly, sometimes incoherent chit-cat that Ben has with himself. Listen to him call B.S. on flaky tests; shake his first at overly-specific CSS selectors; preen about GulpJS build scripts; pontificate on the ROI (return on investment) of personal growth; and, theorize that building - not buying - can sometimes be the smarter (and less bureaucratic) move to make.
