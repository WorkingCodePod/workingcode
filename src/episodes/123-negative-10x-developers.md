In episode 58, we weighed-in on [whether or not 10x engineers actually exist][working-code-58]. On today's episode, we go _hard_ in the other direction, talking about the _much less mythical_ **-10x engineer**: those engineers that seem to actively work in opposition to the greater good, holding unnecessary meetings and flooding the team with a massive amount of documentation. This discussion was directly inspired by the post, [How to be a -10x engineer][taylor-town].
