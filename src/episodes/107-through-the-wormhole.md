[Happy Festivus][festivus], dear listeners! Welcome to our last show of 2022! Closing out "No Effort December", we truly run the gamut this time: Ben talks about the crippling attachment he has to his own fingers (and why he won't work with wood); Adam talks about how excited he is for the v1.0 release of [Svelte Kit][svelte-kit]; and, Tim reflects on the blinding speed with which people seem to be to making science and technology breakthroughs - I mean, we're talking some serious Sci-Fi-level stuff here!
