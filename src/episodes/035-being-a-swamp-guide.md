Software is never "done". And, as it continues to evolve over time, it often gathers a lot of _accidental_ and _essential_ complexity. This makes it harder to on-board new engineers into a legacy application (and a legacy organization). Enter **swamp guides**: the aged and battle-hardened staff who know where all the bodies are buried. These guides can hand-hold new team-members as they walk fresh-eyes through the fog of war, helping them to understand where everything lives and how everything works. And, hopefully, leave the swamp a little cleaner than they found it.
