New Year's Resolutions may be considered a bit cliche by some; and even a bit silly by others; but, there's always value in any opportunity to pause and take stock of your own situation. On this week's show, we share both our **tech** and our **non-tech** goals for the new year. As it happens, we all want to be in better shape - _shocking_, I know. But, when it comes to technology - and tech-adjacent interests - we all have different areas in which we wish to increase our proficiency: build systems, continuous integration, photo editing, TypeScript, mentoring, and product management, just to name a few.

Unfortunately, Tim couldn't be with us on this episode because he and his whole family came down with the Flu! But - spoiler alert - by the time this episode is published, he'll already be back to his wonderful, normal self. And, we sure can't wait to get the band back together!

[00:00:00] **Carol:** I'm in a pretty good spot with what I'm doing at work and where I'm at. I just want to keep growing where I am and become better at this.

[00:00:07] **Adam:** I have to get this in for Tim. You should do Postgres.

[00:00:09] **Carol:** Oh gosh. I guess

## [00:00:13] Intro

[00:00:13] **Adam:** It is show number 57 for early in January. and, on today's show, we're going to talk about our goals for 2022 cause new year got goals. Right. but I guess as you know,

[00:00:41] **Carol:** maybe.

[00:00:44] **Adam:** As usual, we'll start with our triumphs and fails, I guess, Carol, why don't you go first?

## [00:00:49] Carol's Triumph

[00:00:49] **Carol:** Yeah, I'm going to go with a triumph. our holidays were just really good and I'm still celebrating that. And I got some alone time with Steve and the mountains with our puppy. And then I got to spend time with both of my boys. JP came home from college, Peyton got to spend time with his girlfriend home before she had to leave for a family trip.

[00:01:08] **Carol:** So when we just, we had a lot of good family time and there was no work involved. There was no, big moving parts that had to be organized. It was just very relaxing and amazing. And I am very grateful for this past holiday season. And I just want to give a big giant triumph there.

[00:01:28] **Adam:** That sounds.

[00:01:29] **Ben:** absolutely.

[00:01:29] **Carol:** Yeah. Yep. That's me.

[00:01:31] **Carol:** What about you, Ben?

## [00:01:33] Ben's Triumph

[00:01:33] **Ben:** I have a very similar triumph. I'm not a big vacationer. And when I do vacation, it's typically involve some sort of travel or like big family thing, like big moving parts, kind of like what you're talking about. And, we had a family emergency last week. so everyone's a little bit burnt out. And so this week I've done nothing and it's like, literally the best vacation I've ever been on.

[00:01:58] **Carol:** isn't it great.

[00:01:59] **Ben:** had to travel, I didn't have to pack anything. I didn't have to, make a train or a flight or anything like that. And,the, there's a, there's always that cliche that when you get back, you need a vacation from your vacation. But like, I don't need that because I haven't done anything and I feel great.

[00:02:17] **Carol:** I feel energized really energized from this holiday season. And usually I am completely burnt and white and exhausted, like you said, and this, I don't feel it this year and I love that. They love it. yeah,

[00:02:29] **Carol:** So congrats to you Ben.

[00:02:31] **Ben:** Congrats to you as well.

[00:02:33] **Carol:** Thank you. Thank you.

[00:02:35] **Ben:** I will say also, during the holiday season, there's always a formidable amount of eating of cakes and cookies and things of that nature. And typically even as an adult in my forties, there is something that I eat and I don't know what it is exactly that makes me break out in acne. I think it's chocolate.

[00:02:54] **Ben:** I'm not exactly sure, but I have basically made it through this entire holiday season without having any like really embarrassing breakouts.

[00:03:01] **Carol:** Nice

[00:03:02] **Ben:** I'm pretty excited about that.

[00:03:05] **Carol:** It's

[00:03:05] **Carol:** nutmeg.

[00:03:06] **Adam:** excited when you're 40.

[00:03:07] **Ben:** Yeah.

[00:03:08] **Carol:** It's nutmeg. You all are allergic to nut Meg, just like me.

[00:03:12] **Ben:** Oh, man. How about you, Adam? When you got going on?

## [00:03:14] Adam's Triumph

[00:03:14] **Adam:** I'm, we're just going to keep piling on. So this is my first Christmas on antidepressants. Um, you know, I I started doing therapy end of last year, beginning of this year. And, I got on antidepressants, apparently that was something I needed. and it's just been like wonderful. it's like I'm walking around, like, is this is normal.

[00:03:31] **Adam:** This is how people are supposed to feel. This is great. Especially going into the holidays. I realized like three weeks before Christmas that I was. I feel awesome. I'm like in the spirit. I, I think that was my triumph, a couple of weeks ago, it's like, I just, I feel great and happy and I had a wonderful Christmas, nothing was like mine shatteringly, amazing.

[00:03:52] **Adam:** I mean, I'm going to be an uncle again. My brother

[00:03:55] **Adam:** and his wife are

[00:03:56] **Adam:** expecting,

[00:03:58] **Adam:**

[00:03:58] **Adam:** and, according to the due date, the baby would be like the day before his birthday or a couple of days before his birthday. But it probably won't go that long. She had a C-section last time. So it'd probably be early planned C-section this time, but yeah.

[00:04:12] **Adam:** I'm just, I'm happy. Everything is wonderful.

[00:04:15] **Carol:** Isn't it great when you can just enjoy it.

[00:04:18] **Adam:** yeah, and, I also took this whole week off between Christmas and new year's and. I won't say that I've been doing nothing, but I've been like kind of selfish with my time, at least in, in from the perspective of work, right? Like I'm doing family stuff, crossing things off the honeydew list for my wife, spending a lot of time with the kids, and doing stuff that I want to do for me.

[00:04:38] **Adam:** and it's just been very charging. And even though I'm not like, kind of burnt out from spending my vacation, doing work anyway, I it's been so nice that I don't want to go back. I'm not ready to go back to work yet. So.

[00:04:54] **Carol:** I get

[00:04:54] **Ben:** Yeah. I'll tell you. That's a great point because a lot of times towards the end of the vacation, I'm like itching to get back to

[00:05:03] **Carol:** Yes.

[00:05:03] **Ben:** And I don't feel that way at all right now.

[00:05:07] **Carol:** And obviously this is probably the first time I've been like this. Usually I am just, I'm the same way. I'm like, all right, let's just go check and see what's going on. Let's write something like my mind's got to work. Like I can't be lazy anymore. And it fell out one time over this holiday season, I literally was just grateful for every moment I had with my family.

[00:05:27] **Carol:** And it was relaxing.

[00:05:29] **Adam:** Yeah.

[00:05:29] **Adam:** I feel like the last four or five years I've really cultivated the ability to disconnect from work and like turn off notifications from our work Discord and not check my work email when I'm, over the weekends even, and on PTO. And it's very healthy thing to do. and I highly recommend it.

[00:05:48] **Adam:** It's wonderful. and it's just been excellent. I, unfortunately, I was on call for the week of Christmas and there were a couple of alarms that went off, but it was like no big deal yet. Okay. Yes. I had to get up at 1:00 AM for a thing, but it was like, okay, fix it and go back to bed. just something kind of fell over and needed to be stood back up.

[00:06:04] **Adam:** That's all.

[00:06:05] **Ben:** I, my dog has had to go out and pee in the middle of the night, a bunch in the last, like two weeks. And, my wife takes the brunt of it and she refuses to wake me up, but I've had to do it a couple of times. And, oh man, there's only so many days in a row. You can get woken up in the middle of the night and still feel human.

[00:06:23] **Ben:** Even if you, you know, I take her outside, she pees in three seconds and we come back in. It's the falling asleep again at two 30 in the morning where that's, that is not easy for me.

[00:06:34] **Carol:** Yeah.

[00:06:35] **Adam:** I cannot necessarily empathize with you or I don't know what the right word is. Empathize sympathize. I am also lucky enough to be good at turning my brain off. I climb into bed and within five, 10 minutes, I'm asleep.

[00:06:51] **Carol:** Oh, yeah, it's a great superpower.

[00:06:54] **Carol:** Steve will be like, Oh, I can go in the living room and watch something or do whatever. If I'm going to keep you awake. I'm like, I'm already snoring. Don't wake me up again to offer, to leave. I'm like, I can sleep with the lights on. I can sleep in noise. I can just fall asleep, but once I've been deep asleep, if I get woke up, it is harder to be like, all right, let's go back to sleep.

[00:07:15] **Carol:** So the falling asleep up front, I'm great. I can.

[00:07:18] **Carol:** fall asleep driving Starbucks, like the five minute drive. Well, when he's driving, let's be clear. They're not me driving asleep. When I. driving, he has a Tesla now and it drives us, but definitely when he's driving.

[00:07:31] **Adam:** I think, honestly, that might be the other side of the same coin though. Like, like it's easy for me to fall asleep when I want to. It's also unfortunately easy for me to fall asleep when I don't want to, I have fallen asleep behind the wheel

[00:07:43] **Carol:** Oh

[00:07:44] **Carol:** no, scary.

[00:07:46] **Adam:** Yeah. I mean, what the worst of it was like, I kind of veered off the road a little into some grass and I almost hit trees, but I woke up in time and spun us

[00:07:52] **Adam:** around.

[00:07:53] **Adam:** And,

[00:07:54] **Carol:** Oh boy.

[00:07:55] **Carol:** yeah, that's scary.

[00:07:56] **Adam:** yeah, it's, heart-stopping really scary, but you know, I've learned to, to tell when I'm getting too close to that line and either pull over and sleep on the side of the road in a parking lot or have somebody else drive or whatever. But, yeah, my wife who struggles to sleep in our bed in pitch black, like with a white noise machine,she can draw.

[00:08:17] **Adam:** She could probably drive for 48 hours straight. She'd hate everyone in the whole world by then, but

[00:08:22] **Carol:** They married grumpy, but she'd do it.

[00:08:25] **Adam:** Yeah. Anyway, let's let's pivot here So goals for the year. What do you guys want to like new year kind of a clean sheet?

[00:08:34] **Adam:** What do you want to do this year?

## [00:08:35] Fitness Goals

[00:08:35] **Carol:** Yeah. I mean, I can throw out one first. we, that Steve and I decided that we want to get the trifecta for the Spartan races. So last year we did a 10 K 26 or 30 obstacle. I remember a whole bunch of them. It was a big, giant race and we loved it. So we've already signed up for a 5k, a 10 K and now we're looking for dates when he's available to travel, to do, obese or ultra.

[00:09:02] **Carol:** So we will have the trifecta this year. That's our goal. That's our like physical fitness goal for 2022, which means we have to work out pretty hard to be in shape for these. So it's also motivating us to get up and run every day. And I go to the gym every day and lifting and working on strengths that you don't expect to need daily, like grip strength.

[00:09:23] **Carol:** So having to train your grip strength is kind of crazy. But yeah, that's one of my personal ones.

[00:09:28] **Adam:** the trifecta. Does that mean doing it all in one year or is that just, I have done all three.

[00:09:32] **Carol:** Nope. You have to do it all in one year. So the one we did last year won't count because it's November to November and we couldn't get in the others with him not being able to travel, before November. So we just decided to start clean for this year and do it this year.

[00:09:46] **Ben:** and when you say ultra that's, one of the long distance runs or that's the name of a Spartan

[00:09:50] **Carol:** no, it's the name of the Spartan race. it is an ultra it's also, it's a 40 something obstacle. I believe I've got to go look it up and it's a, 21 K or we do the beast. I, may have them flipped in my head. Don't hold me to it, which is like a half marathon, kind of like a 13.1 mile. And then it has the same number or a lot more so of the obstacles that you have to do.

[00:10:13] **Carol:** So we're doing the lighter of the ones, but it's the 5k 10 K and them, whatever's a lighter between the alternative beast.

[00:10:19] **Adam:** I totally get you on the motivation though. Like this is over my shoulder here. This is my one and only running metal. It's the Phillies 5k. and I don't love running, but I really wanted to participate in that. And that got me to do the, like the couch to 5k program

[00:10:34] **Carol:** That's a really good light program to do if you want to get into running. there's multiple that you can do. Nike has one that they do a 5k and then they have a 10 K one and it.

[00:10:43] **Carol:** trains you for six to 10 weeks, depending on what you're doing. And it takes you straight from getting up to just going for a walk to running.

[00:10:51] **Carol:** They're really healthy. So

[00:10:53] **Ben:** Very cool.

[00:10:54] **Carol:** yeah.

[00:10:55] **Ben:** Well, I'll keep it going with fitness-related and, so I have historically been working out in my garage in a half squat rack and I've been squatting for years and years and years. And, I've had knee pain for years and years. and I'm not blaming squatting in any way.

[00:11:13] **Ben:** I'm 100% blaming my flat feet, which suck. I have custom orthotics that hurt and I try various shoes and inserts and all this jazz and like nothing has been great. And, I am going to take an extended break from squatting, and I'm going to be, I joined planet fitness about a month ago at, which is amazing how cheap it is.

[00:11:35] **Ben:** It's like.

[00:11:35] **Carol:** Oh, it's so

[00:11:36] **Ben:** It's like $12 a month or like 1299. It's crazy. I think part of how they do it, it's insane. and you can't pay with a credit card, which I think is part of how they keep the costs so low. You actually have to give them your bank routing number, I guess, cause there's no charge included.

[00:11:50] **Ben:** but you know, I can't work out as, as often because it's my planet, fitness is like a good half hour away, so it's hard to do during the week. but if I can do it on like Friday, Saturday, Sunday, $12 a month, I feel like that's pretty worth it. And,I'm just going to be doing their machines and just trying to give my joints a little bit of a break.

[00:12:08] **Ben:** I've had a lot of shoulder and knee pain for a long time. So just trying to attack it from a different angle. Now

[00:12:14] **Adam:** Is it. So you're going to avoid squatting is that I, they made me sad when you said that, because I love squats. They're

[00:12:19] **Carol:** Oh, well they burn so bad.

[00:12:23] **Ben:** but it's like I'm fighting against myself. It feels like, and again, I'm not blaming squats. I think one, again, I have flat feet. I think it throws my whole leg out of alignment. And when I'm on a machine, like if I'm on a leg press, at least I have a lot more control over where my legs and knees are in 3d space.

[00:12:42] **Ben:** also I work out my garage, like I said, and the floor of my garage is slightly slanted, which I'm sure is like screwing me up in a weird way. So, I just,for a long time now I have felt de-motivated because I feel like my brain says push harder, but my body is not agreeing with me. And I want to get back to.

[00:13:05] **Ben:** a more comfortable point where I feel like my brain and my body are in alignment. And,I, if I'm on machines, I'm hoping maybe that'll help give me time to recover from whatever I'm doing wrong.

[00:13:18] **Carol:** Yeah.

[00:13:19] **Carol:** I,I work out fully on machines. I have always been terrified of free weights just because I fell once and had a bar fall on me. And I was done after that. I was like, never, again, this was when I was like 16, it was younger, but it was enough. I was like, I don't want to do free weights. And I feel like you said, like with the machines, I feel like I have a lot more control and stability and I stand a substantial, li-like lower chance of hurting myself than if I'm over squatting with a bar and Yeah. So I like machines for working out.

[00:13:52] **Adam:** Especially if you're working out alone,

[00:13:54] **Adam:** machines are like the safest thing you can do.

[00:13:56] **Ben:** Speaking of working out alone. That is also part of it for me. When I work out in my garage, it's just me and it's dark and it's quiet and it's, and I'm alone with my thoughts. And when I go to planet fitness, I don't talk to anyone, but there's a lot of people there.

[00:14:10] **Ben:** And if there's, even if I have my headphones on and I'm listening to either music or podcast or something, at least I'm looking around, I'm seeing people and it feels like I'm more engaged with a larger community. If only superficially it's mentally a little easier.

[00:14:24] **Carol:** Yeah. I agree. Since I worked from home, I was like, oh I never interact with humans anymore. Unless I go to the gym, like I order groceries online usually and pick them up at the pickup spot at the grocery store. Like I don't interact with people anymore. So going to the gym, even though I'm not interacting with a single person, I feel that like, I don't know.

[00:14:44] **Carol:** Yeah.

[00:14:44] **Adam:** You're being around him.

[00:14:45] **Adam:** Yeah.

[00:14:46] **Carol:** helps.

[00:14:46] **Carol:** our planet fitness also just, free pizza, like every Thursday.

[00:14:51] **Carol:** Yeah,

[00:14:53] **Ben:** Yeah, that

[00:14:54] **Adam:** that seems counterintuitive.

[00:14:55] **Ben:** that is a no judgment

[00:14:56] **Ben:** zone right

[00:14:57] **Carol:** If you work out, you get pizza after. Yeah, It is like, take your boat, whatever. Congrats on working out on Thursdays.

[00:15:04] **Adam:** so I just realized we did it again. I'm sorry, Tim. We've totally forgot to mention Tim is sick tonight and that's why he, you're not hearing his lovely baritone or whatever bass voice he is. I don't know. Not a singer. yeah,

[00:15:17] **Adam:** so Tim's not

[00:15:18] **Ben:** Sorry, Tim

[00:15:20] **Carol:** bill

[00:15:20] **Adam:** Hope you feel better

[00:15:20] **Adam:** soon

[00:15:21] **Ben:** sending you hate.

[00:15:24] **Adam:** as requested. okay, so you guys both did fitness things, is it okay if we, okay.

[00:15:28] **Adam:** So, I also have a fitness goal for the year and that is to just get back into exercising. So when it became apparent that COVID was not going to just be a couple of months thing, I paused my gym membership, and, basically. There was a whole span of time where I couldn't work out at the gym and I was just like, okay, whatever, this is important for COVID.

[00:15:47] **Adam:** And then they finally opened back up and I got vaccinated and I was all psyched and pumped to go back in there. I took my pre-workout and I drove over there and they're closed like for good. They're not opening back up

[00:15:58] **Carol:** Oh, no,

[00:16:00] **Adam:** a sign on the door. And they're just like, you'll get an email, we're not opening back up.

[00:16:04] **Adam:** and so I was all like, pumped up from the pre-workout as

[00:16:08] **Carol:** you had the, you had the tingles and everything.

[00:16:10] **Adam:** Yeah. And, so, at that point I decided, okay then, so this gym was maybe a five minute drive from my house, which was nice. maybe 10, either way. It was real close, pretty nice and worth it for the motivation.

[00:16:21] **Adam:** Right? Like once I've made that drive there, I'm invested in the workout. So I'm going to go do it, for a long time, I've always said, like, I need that in order to motivate myself to work out and look at me now. When the gym closed, we,I talked to my wife and we decided it's worth it to just get some equipment that I can use from home.

[00:16:37] **Adam:** And I'll do that. And I did that for a long while. And then, in order to get my booster shot, I needed to stop taking my, like I have an autoimmune disease. And, the medication for that would, I guess, conflict with the vaccine. So I was told to skip a dose of the auto-immune disease and get my booster on the day.

[00:16:56] **Adam:** I would've gotten my auto-immune and then go back onto the normal schedule. So I would just totally miss a dose, which are two weeks apart. And so basically I went a whole month between doses and I was in semi significant joint pain because of it. And I just gave myself carte blanche to like, okay, if I'm not feeling good, I'm not going to work out.

[00:17:15] **Adam:** I don't want to hurt myself because I'm,

[00:17:17] **Carol:** Yeah, listen to your body. Yeah.

[00:17:19] **Adam:** Yeah. And then that was the last time that I worked out was when I decided like, okay, I need to step away from this because of the pain stuff, even though I'm back on the auto-immune drugs for months now and totally fine. I just haven't been able to work up the motivation to, to go downstairs to my basement.

[00:17:38] **Adam:** And, we bought a skull, a squat rack and a barbell and a bunch of plate weights and those horse mats from, tractor supply and a nice bench. And so I can do like anything that you can do with a barbell I can do, right. Let's do it like squats and deadlifts and, barbell rows and bench press and like all kinds of stuff.

[00:17:57] **Adam:** and pull-ups on the squat rack, right? Like, so, my goal for now is to just get back on a routine, like no specific strength or whatever weight goals or any. Get back into a workout routine because I need that. I know for sure that I need that my belly over here can tell you that I need that.

[00:18:14] **Ben:** You know, I need that bad.

[00:18:16] **Ben:** I'm giving myself until the new years to basically just keep stuffing myself like a pig, and then I'm going to get strict about it again. Try needle.

[00:18:27] **Carol:** Yeah.

[00:18:27] **Carol:** I was going to say our, like me personally, the thing I've gotten really good at is not. Being really hard on myself. If say, I go work out and I don't do a good job. Like, I am very proud that I started the workout. today I went for a run and I was slow and my hip hurt and my back hurt and it was terrible, but that I'm so proud of myself.

[00:18:47] **Carol:** Like I started it and it isn't the achievement that I'm okay. Celebrating. It's the starting, anything to me is worth celebrating. So I think not having any weight goal, not having any, goal with where you want to be at. That's great. I think you should just celebrate doing it and getting it in routine.

[00:19:05] **Adam:** Heck. Yeah. Don't you also Carol, usually start your workout super early in the morning.

[00:19:10] **Carol:** I have

[00:19:10] **Adam:** So I have to applaud you for that. Like getting up extra early, specifically to work out. Oh, I'm also a morning person, but I, yeah, I don't know if I could set my alarm earlier so that I could work out.

[00:19:22] **Carol:** If I don't, I won't work out. Everything else is more important to me. Once the day starts, I would much rather write code, then go work out. I would much rather cook dinner for my family. I would much rather work on my stuff I volunteer with. So if I don't do it before I start my day, there's a 90% chance it's not going to get done. So that's my like forcing myself to do it.

## [00:19:41] Tech Goals

[00:19:41] **Adam:** Cool. Well, that's a fitness goals for everybody. What about a tech goal?

[00:19:46] **Ben:** My tech goal is I want to deploy a container. And what I mean is the w in my personal life, when I deploy code right now, it's to a managed hosting. I deploy via FTP. And, I used get hub and get for source control. So it's like, I'm not in the total stone ages, but it's all still very manual.

[00:20:11] **Ben:** And at work we use containers and there's a whole deployment pipeline, and I don't really understand how any of it works that we use code ship. I don't even know really how you configure Codeship and how it interacts with everything. So what I would love to do in the upcoming year is pick some sort of small project and just do it from end to end where it, whatever code ship, or some sort of is that I get confused, which one's continuous integration, which one's continuous deployment.

[00:20:42] **Ben:** I guess it's continuous integration is Codeship. I dunno, who knows, I want to do something that has a build process and then that build process creates a container, publishes the container to somewhere. And then that container then gets pulled down to somewhere else that is available publicly. And part of why I want to do that is also is not just to get familiar with that end to end process, but also to get a bit more comfortable with just managing a server.

[00:21:10] **Ben:** I have a lot of insecurities about servers and how you keep them secure and updated and permissions and patches and stuff like that. I've never even used a Unix-based server, which I assume I would be doing with a container. Like my managed hosting is windows.

[00:21:28] **Adam:** Yeah, there are windows containers, but it's not recommended from what I know it like you're paying a lot of, resources to the, into running windows for little gain,

[00:21:43] **Adam:** just so that you don't have to learn you next. Yeah.

[00:21:45] **Ben:** So that's my that's like my big, hairy goal for 2022. I don't know what project I want to use as the impetus for building this kind of thing. I have. I've always had this love affair with building a fitness app. I've wanted to build a fitness app since I was in college. It was actually part of my senior project was designing a fitness app that never came to fruition.

[00:22:08] **Ben:** so I've always been like that, but like, I also don't want it to become so complicated that it detracts from what I'm actually trying to learn, which has all the containerization and the continuous integrations and stuff. so my other thought was, I've always liked poetry and I built a very simple website called big sexy poems.com and it's just an angular app.

[00:22:27] **Ben:** And literally all it does is like you type into it. And it counts out the number of syllables on a particular line. And then, and then you can look up rhymes and synonyms. And so, but there's no persistence, like it's 100% client side, it uses this, a data muse API, and it makes Ajax calls to get all the accounts and stuff.

[00:22:50] **Ben:** so, you re you go to different computer and you've lost all the stuff you've written. So I thought like, it'd be kind of fun to just build like a really simple persist, like user log-in and persistence for that. Maybe using something like auth zero. And, and I don't know something, and I feel like that's simple enough that it wouldn't attract, or it wouldn't distract from me understanding all the container stuff.

[00:23:13] **Carol:** I totally went and looked this up just now. Sorry. I stopped listening for your last sentence. Cause you know, I got curious, I love the top of it. It's like inspired by beauty and then it just changed inspired by lust. I'm like, oh man, this thing is so cool.

[00:23:27] **Adam:** Yeah, it changes more rapidly when you move your mouse over that

[00:23:30] **Ben:** Yeah. Yeah, yeah,yeah,

[00:23:31] **Carol:** Ooh, look at this. Pleasure. That's cool. And I think that's a really good goal to have. server side operations has always been something I love doing, and it was great when I worked with Tim because we got hands-on with everything. Everybody did everything and we'd sat together in each other's offices.

[00:23:52] **Carol:** And when ops was working or when our it team was working on infrastructure, they would have conversations with the engineering side. Like we did a lot of hands-on together. So we knew everything. I didn't get to know that now I am stuck over in my little world of just write the code and then everything else is there.

[00:24:09] **Carol:** And I feel like I'm missing so much of part of what I love that I can see that being something that I would want to do too. So

[00:24:17] **Ben:** pretty cool. Yeah. I didn't know you did that kind of stuff.

[00:24:19] **Carol:** Yeah. Yeah. It's silver mine. Everybody does everything. Everything from DBA staff to engineering, to dev ops to it, support you, learn it all. I mean, you can obviously not do any of it. You can just write code all day long, but because of kind of how I was like 10, same way, you want to know it all and you want to know how it all works.

[00:24:39] **Carol:** So you do it and they let you do it cause, well, it makes sense. If you do a good job to have your hands in and have fun doing it.

[00:24:48] **Ben:** I might get

[00:24:49] **Adam:** So you're giving me some inspiration from maybe some blog posts or something here, but I will throw out, get hub has very generous and easy to use free tiers for, both their actions, which is like, you can use it for CIS. Type stuff. Running your tests on pull requests. Wait a minute. Who am I talking to here?

[00:25:06] **Adam:** I'm running actions as a result of a pull request or merge code, like building a container

[00:25:13] **Ben:** his actions. I don't know if. Codeship but would actions be a kind of re entirely a replacement for something like Codeship?

[00:25:23] **Adam:** I'm not familiar with Codeship specifically, but I know you had mentioned you wanted to build the container,

[00:25:28] **Adam:** you

[00:25:28] **Ben:** yeah. Codeship builds the container.

[00:25:30] **Adam:** Yeah. So we have get hub actions that we'll run some tests and assuming those tests pass, they will build a Docker container and publish that up to Amazon ECR for us because we use Amazon ECS to run that container. And so it makes sense to have them next to each other, but I was going to say, so actions is great and it's, I can't imagine using all of the free tier. Maybe if I had like a hundred really popular open source projects that were getting lots of pull requests in everything, then I could see myself hitting the free tier usage limit

[00:26:00] **Ben:** I didn't realize it was so generous.

[00:26:01] **Ben:** That's

[00:26:01] **Adam:** is. And they also have a container registry, which for as far as I can tell, uh,

[00:26:08] **Adam:** they also have really generous, like container hosting. So I say that generous, probably generous as long as you're not using like a JVM language where you need to pack in a whole bunch of Java stuff. So yeah. I mean like generous if you're doing like node containers or, like a static site sort of thing.

[00:26:25] **Adam:** I don't know what your big, sexy poems, as you said, it's all

[00:26:28] **Adam:** client

[00:26:28] **Adam:** side, so,

[00:26:29] **Ben:** it's currently deployed on Netlify. So it's

[00:26:32] **Ben:** just, uh, uh,

[00:26:33] **Ben:** an NPM based build school. That creates an HTML file that gets pushed to wherever their CDNs get pushed to. I mean, I don't do any of that magic. I just do the build and say like, here's the distribution directory? And then it w Netlify works the magic.

[00:26:48] **Adam:** Oh, I love Netlify.

[00:26:49] **Ben:** Oh my God. So good.

[00:26:51] **Adam:** Yep. our website workingcode.dev is on now.

[00:26:54] **Carol:** Yeah,

[00:26:55] **Ben:** one of the guys at work actually just left to go work for Netlify and, I was his reference. So the woman from Netlify called me to, get a sense of who this guy was. And so we talked about him and then I spent the last, like five minutes of the call, just talking about how awesome Netlify is.

[00:27:11] **Ben:** And I'm like, oh, you guys are crushing it. And like, you're changing the whole landscape and ushering in a whole new, you know, blah, blah, blah. And I dunno, I just, I was very fanboy for a second.

[00:27:21] **Carol:** well, I bet she loved that.

[00:27:22] **Ben:** Yeah. I, I.

[00:27:24] **Adam:** So yeah, I would encourage you at least use that to get started. Now that's only the run for like the build process and the storage of the container, then deploying it somewhere as a whole separate thing. And that's going to be very dependent on what you want to do with it.

[00:27:36] **Ben:** Right. So that's, I haven't even begun to think about that yet. Part of me is just drawn to DigitalOcean for some reason. Cause I feel like their whole persona is making things very easy for developers. And I have to imagine they have something that will just run containers. I don't know offhand.

[00:27:53] **Ben:** but then part of me is like, gosh, should I try to do some Amazon stuff? I'm still very insecure and scared of the complexity of Amazon and all the I am permissions and

[00:28:04] **Carol:** it's over whelming. It

[00:28:06] **Adam:** It is

[00:28:07] **Adam:** absolutely is. And it's really easy to shoot yourself in the foot with a $5,000 a month

[00:28:13] **Ben:** yo

[00:28:14] **Carol:** so good.

[00:28:15] **Ben:** percent. I was actually listening to. Oh, my God. I can't remember his, the shouting into the cloud guy who does the, like this week and Amazon

[00:28:24] **Ben:** podcast,

[00:28:25] **Adam:** yep. I know who you're talking

[00:28:26] **Adam:** about. Um, Corey Quinn

[00:28:27] **Ben:** he had some sort of year round up just recently. And he was joking that Amazon actually has something literally like 33 different ways to run containers in a production environment.

[00:28:39] **Carol:** I believe it completely

[00:28:42] **Ben:** it just sounds overwhelming. And I love the idea of DigitalOcean because they have a lot of just like click deploys, like deploy this droplet and it just magically works, I guess. I don't know. I don't have a lot of experience with that either, but,

[00:28:53] **Carol:** Like, I love having a lot of options when I'm talking about changing tech or how we're using things, but when I'm trying to learn it, I would much rather just have like, let me pick between two things. Like don't make me choose is Wayne 33. That probably all like work differently and can be configured differently.

[00:29:11] **Carol:** I just need simple and let me learn it, then I'll go figure out how to make it better. So I get it. Yep.

[00:29:16] **Carol:** Yep.

[00:29:17] **Ben:** So what other tech goals do we got?

[00:29:19] **Carol:** Well, Adam UGA.

[00:29:21] **Adam:** my big one for the year, I think is going to be TypeScript.

[00:29:23] **Carol:** Yeah, do it.

[00:29:25] **Adam:** I, am a huge fan of linting and, Eastland and prettier. And, I think that adding TypeScript to the mix is going to just sort of take that all to the next level and improve my code insight in vs code and, prevent, certain types of bugs before I even, try it and test it locally in the browser.

[00:29:44] **Adam:** and, like I'm totally bought in. I just haven't done really any of the work. I've watched a couple of two video tutorials on, writing TypeScript and it makes sense. It seems straightforward enough, but I know, youit's going to be a whole new world when I actually start to get my hands dirty.

[00:29:58] **Adam:** And one problem that I think I faced there is that we don't start much from scratch. And it seems like the best way to learn is going to be to start from scratch. And then once you understand, the first 80%, then it's a good time to start converting some of your old stuff. But I may or may not find that opportunity, but I, this year, like I wanted it to happen last year and I just couldn't carve out the time.

[00:30:23] **Adam:** So this year, I think I'm going to prioritize it.

[00:30:26] **Carol:** So I'm going to, I'm going to jump on that with you. So I had put last year I wanted to learn, react, and then I immediately got put on this project and we had to put everything in type script. And I was so happy. I got to learn TypeScript. Like I didn't get reactive, but I got type scripted and I had a blast writing it.

[00:30:43] **Carol:** Like this was my first time working with a project with force linting. So that was new to me. Plus then we had the Jess side of everything for testing, everything we wrote that was new to me. Cause I'm used to the CFML side of the tests with test box and some of the other tools that we use. So I love TypeScript.

[00:31:01] **Carol:** I don't know what makes it so sexy to me, but I loved it. So much so that every time a project pops up where I can go right in that project and go move things over and start putting it into, our AWS infrastructure. I am like, yep. Sign me up. I'm on that project. Take it.

[00:31:19] **Adam:** I think the thing that appeals to me the most about it, again, knowing almost nothing about it is that you seem to get all of the type safety out of it. If you're using the type TypeScript compiler, but it doesn't look and smell like Java,

[00:31:36] **Adam:** which I cannot stand Java center.

[00:31:39] **Ben:** the really wonderful thing about TypeScript to me is that it's typed, but it's structurally typed, I think is the phrase. So, whereas with Java, I think a lot of things have to do. Class-based types, in TypeScript, you can do that as well, but then you can also say it's accepting something that is just has these two properties and that's it.

[00:32:02] **Ben:** And like no one else even has to know that type exists. And as long as somebody invokes the thing and passes in a thing that happens to contain those two properties, like it may contain a whole bunch of other properties as well. Nobody has to care and like, it just works. So you can actually, you don't have to worry about these.

[00:32:20] **Ben:** Like I think with Java, they were only, it's like micro interfaces where you'd have like implements, execute and implement, save and implements to string. And so when you had to, I had another Java person, so I might be talking out my butt here, but I think you'd have to define these crazy method's signatures, where it was like implementing all these different interfaces to make it very flexible.

[00:32:44] **Ben:** And with. It's just so the interfaces become super, super simple because they're structural and not based on these classes.

[00:32:53] **Carol:** Well, I mean, Yeah, everything I write, we usually do write the classes for this. So we like to define everything out very well. So we have like our kind of, I call it like a model. So this is what the data's supposed to look like. This is what we're taking in, and this is what the type looks like.

[00:33:06] **Ben:** yeah. Yeah.

[00:33:07] **Carol:** I enjoy the definition of everything and you have to have that to make it work.

[00:33:11] **Carol:** Like you can't pass in other things. I mean, I think you probably could pass in more, but you can't pass in less, like it's required.

[00:33:17] **Ben:** But like, I mean, you don't even have to, you can adhere to an interface without even exposing that interface. So imagine you have a class and it has a method and when you invoke that method, it's, it's accepting, an object that has to have a name and a created. Inside of your class, you can define that interface and just see like here's interface thing and thing has a name.

[00:33:41] **Ben:** And it created that and not expose that publicly. And then another class that's going to consume your class can also define its own thing to interface that also has a name and created and passed that in. And TypeScript says, well, you have an interface that has name and created that. And I have an interface that has name and created it, and they're not referenced anywhere in the same code base, but it just lines up and it just,

[00:34:04] **Adam:** So as long as it

[00:34:05] **Adam:** has the same shape, then it'll fit through the whole.

[00:34:10] **Carol:** Thanks for I'm just great.

[00:34:11] **Ben:** Yeah. TypeScript and it's such a mature ecosystem. Now, there used to be a lot of, hemming and hawing about how I want to use this third-party library, but no one's defined any types for it yet. I think that's more or less a thing of the past. I think every really popular open source library now has types associated with it.

[00:34:31] **Carol:** Yeah. The, that project that I did at the beginning of the year, the whole g-mail side of everything, all the examples that are in the Gmail, API developer docs, they have a TypeScript version of everything. So I could go in and reference how they were doing it. in TypeScript. Or I could just go pure Java script.

[00:34:49] **Carol:** I think there were a few other options, but I was super happy to see all the support for TypeScript just in general, working of daily use stuff.

[00:34:56] **Carol:** Yeah.

[00:34:57] **Ben:** Yeah.

[00:34:58] **Adam:** Cool.

[00:34:59] **Carol:** luck, Adam. I hope you get to use it.

[00:35:01] **Adam:** Thanks.

[00:35:02] **Carol:** Maya. Yeah, I don't have any.

[00:35:08] **Adam:** Good

[00:35:08] **Carol:** I know,I know that sounds crazy but done. Right? Like I just want to keep growing and I want to do a better job of mentoring like that is it. I don't have, I don't have something I want to go learn. I don't have something I want to do right now.

[00:35:23] **Carol:** I'm in a pretty good spot with what I'm doing at work and where I'm at. I just want to keep growing where I am and become better at this.

[00:35:30] **Adam:** I have to get this in for Tim. You should do Postgres.

[00:35:33] **Carol:** Oh gosh. I guess I, I feel like we are growing our team by our department, the it department from what I heard by like 25% this year. So we're going to be bringing on some big projects to you the beginning of the year, which is going to in itself and, or do you use new tech to learn?

[00:35:54] **Carol:** And so, some slight changes just with how we're working on a day-to-day basis. So I think those are going to take up a lot of my time to where I'm at. I'm not super, like I have to go learn this year. I don't have a big goal. I just, I want to grow where I am and I want to do a better job of mentoring people around me who are trying to learn what I already know.

[00:36:12] **Ben:** That's really nice. All right. that is such a huge weakness for me is mentoring other people.

[00:36:16] **Carol:** hard sometimes. But do you, can you say that, but your blog, it helps people. every day,

[00:36:23] **Carol:** right? It may be that mentoring, But you're

[00:36:25] **Carol:** helping people. You are passing on what you know, to people.

[00:36:29] **Adam:** Yeah, it's a

[00:36:30] **Adam:** different

[00:36:30] **Ben:** take it. Yeah, I'll take it.

[00:36:33] **Carol:** I, we call that a win

[00:36:34] **Carol:** been you're a winner.

[00:36:35] **Adam:** yeah.

## [00:36:36] Adam's Growth Goal

[00:36:36] **Adam:** kind of along the same lines of like, Not focusing on necessarily tech goals, but you know, just growth. I've been listening to I alternate, right? I'll go several audio books. And then I'll take like a month where all I do is listen to all the podcasts I missed while I was listening to audio books.

[00:36:53] **Adam:** And I've been listening to a bunch of different tech podcasts lately. And it seems like there's this trend going on, where everybody's interviewing product managers, like, like we did. and,the more I listened to these things, the more I realized, like I'm kind of on that path, right? So I'm the guy that wants to go in and write documentation about our, the way our stuff works.

[00:37:11] **Adam:** I'm the guy that,stuff is going wrong in the site. And I'm thinking to myself, I'm not like, kind of forced it on anybody else, but I'm trying to think to myself, like, how's this making the customer feel? yes, the customer did something wrong, but. Our fault because we didn't put up the correct guardrails to keep them from, you know, push them into the pit of success type thing.

[00:37:28] **Adam:** Right. And,just the more I learned about product management, the more I feel like as our company grows, that's going to be a role that I'm already kind of filling, in a very unofficial unintentional sort of way. Like, we all kind of spread out to fill the jobs that need to be done.

[00:37:44] **Adam:** And that's just kind of where I've fallen in. And I, it I'm conflicted, I guess, cause I like engineering. And, and I'm sure that having a strong and, I don't know, significant engineering past, right? Like spending a bunch of years working as an engineer is helpful as a product manager. just like, maybe having a business degree is helpful in other ways to being a product manager

[00:38:10] **Ben:** Well, this is what Adam Lehman was saying in his interview that he looks for engineers that gravitate towards management and he starts grooming them because he, to that point engineers or managers who can bring an engineering background to a product discussion, just have better insight.

[00:38:31] **Carol:** Yeah. After our talk with him, I was like, okay, I don't want to manage people. I don't want to go that route. I got burnt out on that, but I could see managing a product, which is just getting some roadmaps out there, getting some plans for it, getting in the face of the customers and figure out what we do to make that better.

[00:38:48] **Carol:** And then communicating the customer goals to the engineering team and just kind of keeping on track with a roadmap, not a people manager, but a product manager. I could see going that route later in my career.

[00:39:00] **Adam:** Yeah. And w one of the other things that I picked up from hearing a bunch of these product manager interviews is it seems to be that the product manager job has kind of very different depending on where you're working. Like what's the culture of the place. some companies seem to kind of carve off some of the product manager role, for tech leads, whereas more, some other, some kind of carved the other way, right?

[00:39:23] **Adam:** Like more of a tech lead role for the product manager. And, I don't know. It makes the whole thing.

[00:39:29] **Carol:** And so you're in a good spot with your company because you get to help drive. If the, if this position, where did you become available in your company? You're going to drive kind of where that goes, because y'all are so early on. So that's cool too, in itself that you get to kind of map out what this goal and what this position looks like with you.

[00:39:45] **Adam:** Yeah, I think just The thing that I keep finding to be interesting is that like, I've kind of accidentally fallen into the role of the like pseudo product manager in our company, just because like, as I learned, right, we read the Phoenix project

[00:40:00] **Carol:** Love

[00:40:00] **Adam:** things from that and yeah, good rec,and, just like there were lessons that I learned from that, that like within weeks or months I was using to, to, in discussions at work

[00:40:11] **Adam:** and,

[00:40:11] **Adam:** yeah. That, that type of growth interests me, I guess I find it interesting enough to seek it out and learn from it and enjoy and appreciate it. And it's like, oh, maybe I am, maybe I should be a product manager. I don't know. Sothat's, I guess, on my radar, at least I do have a couple of other goals that might be interesting to discuss. So the other thing really that I have going on is that,I worked for a really small business and we're trying to grow and we're, we have no outside funding.

[00:40:42] **Adam:** So it's all privately held, I guess that would still be private. I don't know, whatever. but, like I said, no outside funding and, so we very much are a very small scrappy team trying to make stuff happen. And, things are starting to come together to where we can scale out more, meaning like take on more customers with the same amount or very little extra staff.

[00:41:04] **Adam:** And it's exciting. we're sort of at this inflection point. So I mentioned,toward the end of the last year that we had been doing all this work to make multitenant, stuff happened and having some success there, sort of the first thing that we discovered as we got in that door is that, it was more expensive than we were expecting, specifically, well, so long-term, we expect to be running fewer containers to, to serve more customers, but the stepping stone to get there is instead of one easy, two instance per customer, now we have one container per customer and they,

[00:41:36] **Adam:** the, for whatever reason, it's more expensive to run like an ECS container than it is to just buy an

[00:41:43] **Ben:** Oh,

[00:41:44] **Ben:** interesting.

[00:41:45] **Adam:** there are similarly SPECT, probably because you had that ability to recover from crashes and scale it and all that. So for whatever reason, it's slightly more expensive. And so just the act of shutting down our ECE two instances and bringing them up as containers on ECS is more expensive and it's a JVM app.

[00:42:04] **Adam:** So it has significant memory required, right? Like if this was a note app and it needed a hundred megs of memory, that would be a thing. But if, because it's a whole big JVM platform and it, and you're not going to get by with less than well. So I was out this week. I know some of my coworkers were experimenting with like, trying to bring that way, way down, but let's say my on the clock experience thus far has been like, you're not going to get away with anything less than, I guess what Amazon calls a whole VCP.

[00:42:32] **Adam:** and two gigs of memory, like that's the bottom floor of what you can actually operate, but that's triple what we were paying for ISI two instances that would run the app. So, yeah, it's, it was a big pill to swallow, but it's like, okay, so that's our motivation, right? Like we have to solve these problems so that we can, instead of having one container of every customer start to operate like a little cluster of multitenant thing.

[00:42:58] **Adam:** So we might just have to pay through the teeth for a few months while we sort that out. But yeah.

[00:43:06] **Ben:** That sounds like a good goal though.

[00:43:08] **Adam:** yeah.

[00:43:09] **Carol:** Growing

[00:43:10] **Adam:** uh, it's a, it's something to strive for. It lights a fire under your butt, like,

[00:43:14] **Carol:** Oh yeah. You got some motivation to fix this problem.

[00:43:17] **Adam:** yeah.

## [00:43:18] Ben's Photo Editing Goal

[00:43:18] **Ben:** I have a tech adjacent goal,

[00:43:22] **Ben:** which is, I want to get better at photo editing and by better, I mean, no anything, because I don't really know anything about photo editing. for a long time, I used Macromedia fireworks to adjust photos, which basically all I could do was increased brightness and contrast like that. That was the extent of what I understood. and then they were bought by Adobe and I haven't used Photoshop in forever, but they end of lifed fireworks. So I don't even have fireworks anymore.

[00:43:53] **Ben:** So I recently purchased a affinity photo, which is very reasonable compared to the subscription model that Adobe has. I mean, I think it's like 99 bucks or something.

[00:44:04] **Carol:** As was expensive.

[00:44:05] **Ben:** Yeah, it's super expensive and it's not like I have, this is just personal stuff. So it's not like a business with paying for it for me. And I've been watching the tutorials on the affinity photo website.

[00:44:15] **Ben:** They have freaking amazing high quality video tutorials on all the functionality that's in affinity photo. And it's just mindblowing. They have, this one feature called in paint, which is where you go into the photo and you just sort of circle the stuff that you don't want in there. And then they use AI magic or whatever they use.

[00:44:36] **Ben:** And it's just like, poof, it's gone. And they filled it in with things that look like should have been there. I mean, it's mind-boggling

[00:44:43] **Adam:** It sounds like content aware, delete from creative

[00:44:45] **Ben:** yeah, yeah,

[00:44:46] **Ben:** yeah, exactly. But then just all the things like layer masking and using color channels. And I don't even know. It's one of those things, like, clearly you can't just read a book and know it.

[00:44:59] **Ben:** You have to try it and play around. and hands-on like with programming, I can read a book and get like an okay sense of how I might need to approach a problem. It seems like photo editing is not, it's not that in any way whatsoever, so

[00:45:13] **Carol:** Yeah, you need to try the different settings to get the outcome, to see it actually work. yeah. By the way, the thing so-called me.

[00:45:20] **Ben:** Oh, so, so what you, your, what do you use your photo at it?

[00:45:23] **Carol:** Oh, I just have hip sematic on my phone and it's just to fix it before I post it on Instagram,

[00:45:29] **Carol:** but it does the channels. So I'll go in and fix the channel so that my hair looks red again and not like blind looking, which then usually fixes other colors or it causes people in the pictures to look very orange.

[00:45:41] **Carol:** So then I have to adjust the blues and change the channels there. But yeah,

[00:45:46] **Carol:** that's it. That's pretty much all I do.

[00:45:48] **Adam:** Redhead problems

[00:45:49] **Carol:** Redhead problems

[00:45:50] **Ben:** than I even know. So, so that's one of my soft goals is just to get better at that kind of a

[00:45:55] **Carol:** Yeah. Yeah.it's nifty. I have some photographer, friends, and whenever they take pictures like of the boys or my family or whatever, I'll see the before and after I'm like, you are a genius. You have magic hands. Cause this is crazy. Like what you can make happen.

[00:46:11] **Adam:** before smartphones got good cameras, I was getting a little bit into photography and I had a nice DSLR and I bought Lightroom and which is like a digital dark room. Right. That's why they call it light room.

[00:46:23] **Carol:** That's

[00:46:23] **Adam:** and

[00:46:23] **Carol:** right?

[00:46:24] **Adam:** yeah.

[00:46:25] **Adam:** Yeah. And, I, so I learned to shoot raw and that way I could adjust everything in post that I screwed up in the camera and. It was great. I got really great photos out of it. And now it's like, why bother the smartphone? Camera is just so good. Like I'm sure. I'm sure if I wanted to take the time, I could make them a little bit better, but like my skill level is not enough to make it worth the time and effort just to get them into the, to the app so that I could some.

[00:46:56] **Ben:** Yeah. Yeah, totally. I mean, that's when I edit stuff right now, I'm using, what do I use? I use a, I think an app from Google or no, it's called Snapseed.

[00:47:07] **Carol:** Oh, that one's so good.

[00:47:09] **Ben:** It's really good.

[00:47:10] **Carol:** It's like 10 years old too.

[00:47:12] **Ben:** is it, I wish I, I looked up, I wish they had a desktop version, but I think they only have

[00:47:16] **Ben:** mobile and it's really cool.

[00:47:19] **Ben:** Like they have all kinds of built-in looks, but then you can adjust the vibrance and the brightness and the contrast and the shadows and the highlights. And then you can add vignettes and frames and it's really

[00:47:31] **Ben:** it's. Yeah, it definitely makes my pictures of Lucy look a lot better than, they wouldn't have.

[00:47:37] **Carol:** Do you remember when star, I don't know if you guys are Starbucks fans, but Starbucks used to every week would have a little card you could get when you picked up your cup, that would give you a free app. And it was whatever app it was that they supported that week or whatever. Yeah, Well, they used to ended that you also could get free downloads of songs on your playlist or apple.

[00:47:57] **Carol:** So you got the songs for

[00:47:58] **Carol:** free, right? So you have to buy, this was like, again, 10 years ago, Snapseed was one of those. So I got it free and now everybody has to pay for it.

[00:48:07] **Ben:** Yeah, it's really good app.

[00:48:09] **Carol:** love it. Yeah. Yeah. I haven't used it in a while cause I switched over to hip sematic. Yeah. Cool, cool. Cool.

## [00:48:14] Carol's Family Goal

[00:48:14] **Carol:** Well, I only have one more goal if we want to talk about it.

[00:48:17] **Carol:** my youngest will start his senior year. And,yeah. In high school.

[00:48:24] **Carol:** So, he's finishing up his junior year and we'll start a senior year and we have some big plans after, with moving and traveling and just stuff. So I want to spend a lot of time with my family this year.

[00:48:35] **Carol:** So we're going to go see James at college and we're going to do some trips and things just because I'm realizing that this is my last year with a kid at home. Cause the following he'll be graduating and off to college and doing his own thing. And I just, I want to make sure that I spend quite a bit of time this year focusing on my family.

[00:48:54] **Ben:** Well, that's very nice

[00:48:55] **Carol:** Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's the mom thing to do is what

[00:48:58] **Ben:** I

[00:48:58] **Ben:** guess. So you you could gradually, you can like crossfade in time with the dog and like start to crossfade out time with the kid so that by the end of the year, you're spending all your time with the dog

[00:49:11] **Carol:** puppy.

[00:49:11] **Ben:** notice that he's gone.

[00:49:12] **Carol:** So it's funny because when I went to Vegas, the first time Steve had to travel as well. So we had to make arrangements for the puppy because she couldn't be boarded yet because she wasn't vaccinated. So she's not fully vaccinated. So she can't be around other dogs cause she'll get sick. So my oldest sign Keppra at college.

[00:49:29] **Carol:** So I called multiple times a day, FaceTime the dog. And finally he's like, I swear to God, you miss this dog way more than you ever missed me going off to college. I was like, it's just different. Okay.

[00:49:44] **Ben:** That's right.

[00:49:45] **Adam:** I'm a different person.

[00:49:47] **Carol:** Yeah,yeah. Yeah. That's true. I think she's definitely gonna replace the kid, the like that part of my life pretty quickly. And we love her. So that's me. That's my goals. all I got.

[00:50:02] **Adam:** Does anybody have any books that you're looking forward to reading this year?

[00:50:05] **Ben:** I'd like to read something in general. nothing specific, but I haven't, I don't think I've read a book hardly at all this year. And usually I'm better about reading tech books. I like tech books a lot. but I've just been had, I just had my head down and work and stuff.

[00:50:20] **Adam:** I really need to finish the, what is it called? Test-driven development by example book, because I started it in 2021 and I can not finish it in 2022, because then there will be a full calendar year. And it's not even that big of a book. I just, I have so many priorities I'm juggling as like

[00:50:37] **Adam:** yeah,

[00:50:38] **Ben:** well, we had talked briefly about doing a, another book club or something like a book club. I think.

[00:50:44] **Adam:** yeah. a slightly different format when we do the episode, but yeah. Another read another book.
