This week on the show, we have Tim—our only host with screen acting experience—read from [The Grug Brained Developer][grug-brained], "A layman's guide to thinking like the self-aware smol brained". This guide uses fun, caveman'esque language to point out the challenges and missteps that we often take in software development. And, how keeping things simple - for easy _smol brain_ consumption - will often lead to better software outcomes.
