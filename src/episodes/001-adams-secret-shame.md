## Triumphs & Fails

- **Adam's Triumph:** His team realized that they could write a tool that would log, per controller method, how many times it had been run, whether or not it threw exceptions, and some performance stats, which is reducing the pain of transitioning app server platforms without a comprehensive test suite. They're currently at 90% tested!
- **Carol's Fail:** Having just started a new job, she thought she would make a good first impression by bringing down the production site!
- **Tim's Triumph + Fail:** A product he's been working on developing in secret for FOUR years is finally going to see the light of the day... just not through his years of persistence trying to push it past the finish line.
- **Ben's Triumph + Fail:** A R&D project failed to get any traction, but on the plus side he got to delete thousands of lines of code!

## Notes & Links

- The VS Code plugin that Adam couldn't think of is [Git Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)
- [Cargo Cult Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming)
- CFML ("ColdFusion Markup Language") a.k.a. [ColdFusion](https://coldfusion.adobe.com/) is a web-dev language and app server that the four of us have some shared history with. [Lucee](https://www.lucee.org/) is its open source alternative engine.
- Spoiler alert: You can write awful code in every language!
- "Life with chapters" is a concept stolen from the [No Dumb Questions](https://www.nodumbquestions.fm/) podcast, which is fantastic, and a huge inspiration for Working Code. If you don't already listen, give them a shot!
- There are a variety of different ways people prefer to learn, but teaching a concept is the best way to help yourself find your weak spots.
- Never compare your beginning to someone else's middle!
- The Martian is a fantastic [movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3659388/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) and a better [book](https://amzn.to/3g2S3qp); and yes, the [audiobook](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Martian-Audiobook/B082BHJMFF?pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=N31P5MVW485ZX4RD8C5D&qid=1606956278&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&sr=1-1) was narrated by Wil Wheaton, of Star Trek fame.
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is an interesting new(ish) idea in the world of web API's.
- "The right tool for the job"? NOPE. The right tool for the job, for the team, at that particular point in time. You heard it here second!
