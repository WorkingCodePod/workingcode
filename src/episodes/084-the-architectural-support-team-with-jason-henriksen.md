This week on the show, we interview [Jason Henriksen][jason-henriksen] who works alongside Carol as a Software Architect at Clear Capital. According to Jason, every engineer does some degree of _architecture_, whether they know it or not. In fact, there's a lot of overlap between what Jason does and what your average web developer does. Which is why he calls his team the "Architecture Support" team. Their goal isn't to hand down edicts and pass out proclamations. Instead, Jason's goal is to build bridges between teams, help identify common pain points, propagate best practices, and lovingly guide the company in the right _technical_ direction.

Also, special thanks to Tim for _only asking great questions_!
