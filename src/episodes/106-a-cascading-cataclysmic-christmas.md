This week, we continue to lean into "No Effort December", talking about a hodgepodge of both tech and non-tech topics. Since we're heading into Christmas, we start off talking about how challenging it is to buy gifts, especially for the _grown-ass_ adults in our lives. We also share some of our favorite Christmas movies; and, the movies which have absolutely nothing to do with Christmas, but which we love to watch in the winter anyway. We also dig into some modern CSS advances; including our fear that CSS selectors will quickly become more like Regular Expressions: fun to write but impossible to read!
