On today's show, we reflect on the YouTube video, [15 Years of Dev in a Nutshell][15-years]. A few years ago, people were complaining about "JavaScript Fatigue" - this sense that there was a new JavaScript library or framework coming out every day; and, that the race to stay up-to-date in the industry was simply overwhelming. Now, take that feeling, and expand it to include _everything_ in a web development career, from front-end frameworks to databases to server-side rendering to edge-computing. _It's a lot!_ And, it's easy to feel that we engineers are "Juniors for Life": always learning, always evolving, and &mdash; perhaps &mdash; never really mastering anything?
