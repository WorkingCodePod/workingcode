This week on the show, the crew looks back on the first 70 episodes of Working Code and reflects on what's working, what's not working, and what we'd like to see in the future. I think we all agree that we've made it a lot farther than we thought we would. And, thanks to [Matt at Z-Cross Media][zcross], we always end up sounding _totes profesh'_ on tape even when we sounded like bunch of monkeys in the recording studio. We've also been super thrilled to see our Discord community become such a lively and diverse forum, even if half of it is just people mocking Ben for not having any tests. We're all excited to see how the show evolves; and, we hope you come on this adventure with us!
