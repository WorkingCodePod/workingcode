Oxford Dictionary included **"doomscrolling"** in their "word of the year" report for 2020; we're all feeling pandemic fatigue; many people still believe in wide-spread election fraud; the Georgia senate race was a nail-biter; and - oh yeah - we recorded this show the day after the [storming of the United States capitol building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_storming_of_the_United_States_Capitol).

It's all been more-than-a-bit surreal.

But, in the face of such physically and emotionally trying times, we look forward to a new year of possibility. Whether it's taking control of our finances, finding ways to be more active, building up our personal brand, or becoming the blacksmiths that we always knew we could be, the crew shares their *personal* and *professional / technical* goals for this burgeoning new year. As the Phoenix rose from the ashes, so too - we hope - 2021 will rise from the smoldering dumpster fire of 2020.

## Triumphs & Fails

- **Adam's Triumph:** With 2020 just behind us, the Georgia Senate run-off keeping us on the edge of our seats, the [insurrection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_storming_of_the_United_States_Capitol), and plenty of "doomscrolling", he managed to kick off 2021 with a somewhat productive week. He's reminded of a quote from [Cory Doctorow](https://craphound.com/)'s latest book: "I'm not OK, but I'm going to be OK. I'm coping, but I have a lot to cope with."
- **Ben's Triumph:** Coming off the two-week "deployment freeze" at work, he managed to rebase, merge, and deploy the 20-something small git branches that he had amassed over the holiday. It took a few days, but everything went swimmingly!
- **Carol's Triumph:** She accidentally discovered her son (16yo) and his best friend listening to **our podcast**; and, they loved it! Woot woot! We are totes connecting with the youths!
- **Tim's Triumph:** In the aftermath of the insurrection and storming of the US capitol building, he managed to *not curl up in a ball* and rock back-and-forth in the corner. Given the context, this was a pretty momentous effort.
