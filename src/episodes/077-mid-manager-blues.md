This week, on the show, we check-in with Carol to see how she's adjusting to her new role. Carol was recently promoted to a position in which she is a Manager some of the time and an individual contributor (IC) the rest of the time. This setup has a lot of advantages; but, it is not without its challenges. Just last week, she was deep in the coding zone, on the cusp of solving a hard problem, when she had to stop what she was doing and jump into a meeting. This left her with a residue of resentment (in the moment), especially when the first few minutes of the meeting were nothing more than water cooler banter. To be clear, Carol _absolutely loves_ what she is doing; and, she loves being a force-multiplier for her company; but, she's still in the process of finding a comfortable equilibrium.
