This week on the show, Adam and Ben talk about the "unhappy paths" in software design. An unhappy path - also known as a "sad path" - is _anything that can go wrong_ during the consumption of a product. Some unhappy paths are nothing more than unanticipated edge-cases in the code while other unhappy paths are caused by poorly designed user interfaces (UI) that lack necessary constraints and affordances. But of course, it doesn't much matter why something is breaking, if our customers are unhappy, it is our job to fix it.
