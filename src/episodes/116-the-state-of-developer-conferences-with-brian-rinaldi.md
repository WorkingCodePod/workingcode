[Brian Rinaldi][brian-rinaldi], Developer Experience Engineer at LaunchDarkly and long time friend of the show, recently wrote a blog post that was picked up in the [TL;DR newsletter][tldr]. His post, titled [The State of Developer Conferences][brian-rinaldi-post], shares a theory as to why both online and IRL (In Real Life) conferences are struggling to reach pre-pandemic attendance. Brian, who's been running conferences for 15-years, has a keen understanding of who attends events; and, why the demographics of attendees might be shifting. Conference organizers around the world are reading Brian's post and are nodding in strong agreement.
