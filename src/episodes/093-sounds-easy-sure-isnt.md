On Adam's team, whenever anyone uses the phrase _"just"_ to describe a level-of-effort, everyone jumps in and echoes "just" using air-quotes. Because, as many of us have learned over the years, nothing is ever as simple as it seems, especially in the world of web development. On this week's show, we talk about some of those tasks that end up being way more complicated than they _should have been_. Topics include: vertically aligning content, using JavaScript in 2022, logging data with sufficient context, tracking who made changes to a database, and storing notification flags for users that _may never come back to your application_.
