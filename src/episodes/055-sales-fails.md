When you consider the hourly-rate of everyone in the room, meetings can be shockingly expensive. And, if it's a sales meeting, both _actual_ and _opportunity_ costs are on the line. Which is why we practice our sales pitches and offer up a sacrifice to the Demo Gods. But sometimes, that's not enough. On today's show, Tim and Adam share their sad tales of _sales fails_; and illustrate why it's so important to go into any meeting with a rock-solid plan-of-attack.
