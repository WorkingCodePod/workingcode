After years of wanting to build a fitness tracking application, Ben has finally started to write code for [Dig Deep Fitness][dig-deep-fitness]. But, starting a new project from scratch isn't something that we engineers do very often; and, all of the features that we take for granted - session manage, error logging, rate limiting, email delivery - those foundational aspects all need to be created when we start something new. On today's show, Ben walks us through the pragmatic choices that he's made in order to try and keep progress moving forward even if it comes at the cost of elegance.
