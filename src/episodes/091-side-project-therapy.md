On last week's show, we talked about "Side Hustles" - those extracurricular activities that we do in order to earn a little extra income. On this week's show, we want to talk about the flip-side to that coin: the coding that we do on the side because we **freakin' love coding**! Carol celebrates the WordPress site that she's built and now maintains for her son's band, including the ability to accept payments and donations. And, Ben talks about trying to build a feature flag system using Lucee CFML and Angular. He also confesses that his blog has historically had a negative impact on his resolution to do more exploratory work. We also get to argue a bit about _just how sexy_ TypeScript actually is.
