Twenty-two years ago, [Joel Spolsky][joel-spolsky] wrote an article titled, [The Joel Test][joel-test], which outlines 12-steps for evaluating the quality of a software team. At the time, Joel was working with Microsoft, building products that were delivered on CD-ROM. As such, his day-to-day workflow was somewhat different than the kind of work many of us are used to doing today. That said, much of what he had in his 12-point litmus test still holds true! Which I believe is a testament to how fundamental his insights were. This week on the show, the crew reviews Joel's list, gives each item our personal _Yay_ or _Nay_, and then adds a few requirements of our own.

Also, if you want a quick run-down of what we discussed, Adam summarized much of what we talked about in [The Working Code Test][adam-tuttle-test] over on his blog.
