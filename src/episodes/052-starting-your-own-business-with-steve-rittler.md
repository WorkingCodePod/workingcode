On this week's show, Adam interviews his long-time friend and boss [Steve Rittler][steve-rittler], founder and CEO of [AlumnIQ][alumniq]. Once a software engineer himself, Steve discusses his journey from individual contributor (IC) to business leader; and, how he sees his role as the boss from both a practical and a philosophical standpoint. For Steve, it's always been about changing the world using whichever tools he had at his disposal. And, when those tools were no longer effective, that's when he started to grow a team, a business, and a collection of trusted advisors - so that he could continue to take on and solve larger, more complex problems.

> "What starts us as software developers in the first place is wanting to fix the world with whatever lever we have that we can put our hands on." &mdash; Steve Rittler
