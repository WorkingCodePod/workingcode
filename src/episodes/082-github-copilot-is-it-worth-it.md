This week on the show, the crew talks about [GitHub Copilot][github-copilot]. After being in private beta for several months, this _"AI pair programmer"_ is now generally available as a paid product for $10/month or $100/year. But is this something people want to pay for? Will a price put the kibosh on grassroots adoption? Are there pros-and-cons to different pricing models? And, is there ever going to be a world in which Ben can get past his own fanatical formatting tendencies?
