This week on the show, the crew talks about documentation. Yay! As developers, there's no doubt that we all love consuming great documentation - especially for APIs. But, nary a one of us enjoys the process of creating documentation. Except maybe Adam, who's oddly passionate about communication. For the rest of us, however, documenting our choices and our subsequent outcomes feels a bit of a slog. It's never clear when we should be writing documentation; it's never clear what we should be documenting; and, it's never clear just how much detail we need to include. Sometimes, ironically, it seems that the more thoroughly we document a topic, the more likely it is to be misunderstood. So, that's awesome!
