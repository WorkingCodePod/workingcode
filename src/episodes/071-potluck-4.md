This week on the show, the crew discusses a potluck of tasty topics. Ben is trying to figure out what project he wants to use as his vehicle for learning Docker and container-based deployments. Adam wants to completely overhaul his data synchronization workflow, but is having a lot of trouble getting excited about the work (despite all of the exciting ingredients). Carol is being worn-down by the analysis phase of a project and just wants to start _doing the work_ and accruing some wins for her team! And, Tim just can't wrap his head around Functional Programming (FP) - I mean, how the heck can you possibly program anything without `IF`-statements?!
