Do you write "new and original" code that is "useful" and has a "non-obvious function"? If so, your code may qualify for a patent. A patent can help prevent other people from using or selling your software. That said, which engineer among us isn't write _new and original_ code every day? Software patents are weird and fuzzy and open for way too much interpretation. And, in the software industry, they seem to give "patent trolls" a lot of unpleasant leverage.

This week, the crew - **which has absolutely no legal training whatsoever** - talk about patents, copyrights, research & development tax credits, building software, job hopping, and best practices. And, if you don't care at all about software patents, level-up your view of the world with this quote from Adam:

> People don't burn-out from too much work, they burn-out from too much unfulfilling work.
