Every software application has "technical debt". Some of that debt is acquired through meaningful consideration: short-term value gained in lieu of longer-term ease-of-maintenance. And, some of that debt is obtained incidentally through a lack of experience and a dearth of business knowledge. This week, the crew discusses technical debt in their web applications. And goes so far as to say that taking on technical debt is a necessary negotiation within every successful product development life-cycle.
