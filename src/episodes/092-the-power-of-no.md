This week on the show, the crew talks about the Power of No. For many of us, saying "No" is usually a challenge. Saying "Yes", on the other hand, is usually the path of lease resistance. Saying "Yes" also feels good. In fact, saying "Yes" has so much appeal that we often rush into saying "Yes" to work before we even understand what that work entails or how urgent that work actually is. And, in many cases, that eager "Yes" ends up leading to a future failure. Which is why getting to "No" - or "No, But" - can help us maintain both our sanity and our professional relationships.
