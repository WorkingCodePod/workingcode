This week on the show, the crew discusses a topic submitted by [Mingo Hagen][mingo-hagen]: _Do developers wear too many hats, do they spread themselves too thin, and does the work suffer because of it?_ There are clears benefits and drawbacks to wearing a lot of hats. Knowing a little bit about a lot of things can cut down on communication overhead and enable teams to move faster. But, without specialization, solutions will almost certainly be sub-optimal; and, "best practices" may not even be known to the engineer. Ideally, a team should consistent of both _generalists_ and _subject-matter experts_. This kind of balance creates a "healthy tension" that tempers perfectionism with pragmatism and keeps everyone moving forward at the right pace.
