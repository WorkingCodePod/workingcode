People don't burn out because they have too much work to do, they burn out because they feel powerless. And, for Ben, feeling powerless correlates strongly with doing work that he doesn't believe in. Which is why he's never understood the notion of, "Disagree and commit". After all, in order to quell the feelings of dissent, he has to numb a fundamental part of who he is; and, he's convinced that such a technique can't be good for the overall creative process.

To quote Elie Wiesel:

> The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference. The opposite of art is not ugliness, it's indifference. The opposite of faith is not heresy, it's indifference. And the opposite of life is not death, it's indifference.

So what is the opposite of disagreement? Is it _agreement_? Or, is it _indifference_?
