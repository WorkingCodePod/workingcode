On today's show, we all bring something juicy to consider. Carol kicks things off with some trepidation about becoming an independent contractor; Tim shares an article on [Technical Debt][tech-debt] and digs into the subtle differences between _tech debt_ and _bad code_; Ben is befuddled by the fact that "common sense" is apparently wildly subjective; and, Admin introduces us to [Bloom Filters][bloom-filters].
