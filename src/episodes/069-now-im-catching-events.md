This week, Carol talks to us about how her Support team manages communication with their customers. And, how she'd love to find an easy way for one Support engineer to know that _another Support engineer_ is currently working on a given ticket. She's been exploring the use of WebSockets and "presence channels" as a means to provide feedback within the Support platform. And, more generally, she's been looking into the concept of Publish and Subscribe (often referred to as Pub/Sub) as a means to push information from one service to another. We talk a lot about [Pusher][pusher] - a fully-managed WebSocket SaaS offering; and, consider other techniques that might be helpful.
