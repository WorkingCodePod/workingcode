This week on the show, Adam and Ben examine a variety of random topics: Adam loves watching conference videos on YouTube; Ben is feeling terribly insecure about falling behind in the field of web development; neither of us can believe that Elon Musk is forcing his employees back into the office; and, how is it possible that some people seem have so much free time - what the heck is their secret?!
