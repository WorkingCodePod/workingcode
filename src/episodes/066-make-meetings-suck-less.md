For many of us, meetings feel like a necessary evil. We love to complain that we have too many meetings; and, that most of them are useless. However, forgoing meetings and attempting to solve problems and reach consensus asynchronously can feel like _even more_ of a drain on our time and effort. We all have some degree of meeting PTSD. But, none of us is really sure what to do about it.

This week on the show, the crew talks about their love-hate relationship with meetings. And, demonstrates that we're all a little different when it comes to right-sizing our meeting agendas. Carol, with her team of 20, burns through her standup in under 30-minutes. Ben, with his team of 3, spends the first 20-minutes of each stand-up just talking about movies. And, both of them are happy with their stand-up experience.

That's part of the problem - there is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to good meetings. That said, we do all agree on a few things: silence can be golden; it's OK (but hard) to leave irrelevant meeting; and, no meeting attendee should _ever_ have to prepare for a meeting a head of time - **don't be giving people homework**!
