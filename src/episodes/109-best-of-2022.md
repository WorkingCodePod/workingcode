On today's show, [Matt Cavender][matt-cavender] &mdash; the man who turns our incoherent babbling into meaningful thought &mdash; is gonna share a selection of his favorite clips from the past year (2022). Adam, Ben, Carol, and Tim are taking the week off to recover from our families and work off some of those food babies. But, fear not dear listeners, the team will be back next week to ring in 2023 - Working Code style. Here's hoping y'all had a lovely holiday and a happy new year!
