Under the right circumstances, application and error logs can be magical. They can shed light on how a system is behaving - or misbehaving; and, they can provide a path forward in an emergency situation. But, logs do come at a cost. Not only is there an actual dollars-and-cents cost to aggregating and storing logs, having _too many_ logs can end-up reducing the signal-to-noise ratio which can make it _harder_ to debug a running application.

This week on the show, the crew talks about different categories of logging, why some logging is required for regulatory purposes, how you can replace certain logs with telemetry and metrics, and why you should absolutely never ever email yourself errors... except for when you should; because it's easy; and because we never learn from our mistakes.
