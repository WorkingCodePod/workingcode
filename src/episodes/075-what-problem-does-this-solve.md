Carol - who has recently stepped into a managerial role - is facing an interesting situation: her company wants to start implementing process changes across the board. However, Carol's own team is _kicking ass and taking names_; and, she can't understand how any of the proposed changes will actually make her team more effective. In fact, she believes that some of the changes will be counterproductive for her team. So, the question becomes: how does she push-back against the proposed changes without looking like an antagonist or a contrarian?
