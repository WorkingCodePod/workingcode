In the 20+ years of Ben's career, he can't remember ever seeing a person in a leadership position get fired. He's seen plenty of people leave a company to "explore other opportunities", typically accompanied by much praise and congratulations. He assumes that at least some of these people _were actually fired_; but, were allowed to depart under friendly terms. He poses this question to the crew: assuming that his assumption is valid, is suppressing this information healthy for the company (perhaps an effort to keep morale high)? Or, is it a form of [gaslighting][gaslighting] that creates confusion and dissent within the organization?
