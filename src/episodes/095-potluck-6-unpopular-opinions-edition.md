This week on the show, we tip our hats to the [Go Time podcast][go-time] and have ourselves an **Unpopular Opinion** potluck. This means sharing ideas for which we feel strongly; but, which may not be so popular in the broader programming community. Topics include password rotation policies (which are dumb), relational databases (which are stupendous), the technical ability of an executive leadership team (which is important), the user experience (UX) of forms (which is often over-thought), automated deployments (which should be based on tags), and code duplication (which can certainly be the right approach).
