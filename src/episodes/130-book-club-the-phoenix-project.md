On today's show, we have our first book club discussion about [The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win][phoenix-project] by authors Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford. We review chapters 3-6 and talk about how Adam's recent compliance work has given him a fresh perspective on the 190-page spreadsheet of vulnerabilities portrayed in the book. It's interesting how a security team can have a deeply collaborative relationship with a company that feels, at least for some, to be purely adversarial.
