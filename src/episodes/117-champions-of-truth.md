On [episode 114][working-code-114] of the show, in effort to balance out the somber tone of Carol's unfortunate layoff, we decided to have a little fun and play **Two Truths and a Lie**. On today's episode we review the listener submissions and crown the **one winner** who correctly selected all of our lies. And the prize goes to.... _listen to the show_!
