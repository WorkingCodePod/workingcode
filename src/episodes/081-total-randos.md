This week on the show, the crew shares some of the random stuff that they've been dealing with at work. Carol is about to submit a PR (Pull Request) that accounts for 8-weeks worth of commits; and, she's already warning her engineers that it's gonna be beefy! Ben wonders if he's been fooling himself into his love of Lucee CFML's "Tag Islands"; or, if there's something fundamentally more enjoyable about the developer ergonomics of the `CFQuery` tag. And, Tim's been working on remaining PCI (Payment Card Industry) compliant by scrubbing credit card numbers out of his customer's _"name" fields_; because, as it turns out, customers will jam a credit card number in just about any form field that they find!
