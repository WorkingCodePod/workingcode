Van Wilder reminds us to enjoy the moment, warning us _"Don't take life too seriously, you'll never make it out alive."_ And while this is a jocular take on our own mortality, the truth is such that the total cost of death isn't levied against the dead, it's wrought upon the living - the ones left behind. To ease their transition in the wake of loss, we can prepare for own departure; and, provide a plan for our own digital landscape and social networks.

This week, inspired in part by a [post-mortem checklist][chrissy-gh] created by [Chrissy LeMaire][chrissy-lemaire], the crew shares their thoughts and experiences with death. And what steps they've taken—_or not yet taken_—to ease the terrible, yet inevitable, burden on our loved ones.
