Working Code is Adam's brain-child. He wanted a podcast that was more conversational and casual in the web-technologies space, and couldn't find one he liked, so he created it.

Our goal is to make it feel like we're having a really inclusive conversation at the company water-cooler, or in the hallway between sessions at a conference. You might walk away motivated to go look into a topic deeper, but chances are good you're not going to learn the minutiae of any technical topic from us. We want to entertain, inspire, and motivate you -- or to put it another way, make your coding career more enjoyable.

If you want to learn more about each host and our journies into web-development, we recorded episodes for that! [Episode 7](/episodes/007-origin-stories-pt1/) has Ben and Tim's origin stories, and [episode 8](/episodes/008-origin-stories-pt2/) has Carol and Adam's origin stories.
