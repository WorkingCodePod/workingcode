Thanks for your interest in supporting the show! You rock!ðŸ¤˜

We're just happy to have an excuse to talk to each other and share our thoughts with the world. ***Above all else, thank you for listening!***

## Tell a friend

One of the best things you can do to support the show is help us get more listeners. Tell your friends and coworkers about the podcast. A word of mouth referral is worth dozens of 5-star ratings to someone who is trying to decide what to listen to.

## Make a one-time donation

If monthly donations aren't your thing and you'd rather make a one-time donation, email us at <a href="mailto:workingcodepod@gmail.com">workingcodepod@gmail.com</a> and we'll figure out the best mutually agreeable tool.

## Become a Patron

If you think we've earned it we would love to have you as a supporter on Patreon:

### Benefits for Patrons

To show our appreciation for our patrons, we provide them these benefits:

Every patron, at every tier, gets a lifetime invitation to our Discord. Even if you end your subscription, keep your Discord membership! Thanks for being rad, and enjoy hanging out with the other rad patrons!

1. Our first tier is just $4 per month; ostensibly $1 per episode. For months containing 5 weeks, the 5th one is on us! This tier only includes Discord membership.
2. Middle-tier and higher patrons get a private early-access feed where we post our episodes as soon as they're ready, possibly as much as a week early! This feed also includes our [`$Aftershow`](#aftershow).
3. Top-tier supporters are truly embodying the spirit of [Patronage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronage) and helping fund the show in a way that sustains us long-term. It's possible that there's nothing we could do to repay this kindness, but we're going to do our best! We'll read your name (or a surrogate moniker of your choosing) on every show, and whenever we do something new and exciting (merch? special goodies?) these fine folks will get it all first.

After we end every episode we keep the microphones recording for another 10-20 minutes and talk about... well, anything we want to! Topics there are random and everything is fair game! Sometimes it's secret stuff, sometimes it's completely random, sometimes we'll tease it during the episode. Like a box of chocolates with no map, you never know what you're going to get!

For instance, this happened:
